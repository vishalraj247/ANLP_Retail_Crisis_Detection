Is Amazon done disrupting retail?,"Published Dec. 5, 2022","Amazon has spent the better part of a quarter century forcing retailers of all stripes to innovate, speed up and compete. The company premised its great disruption on its laser focus on the customer — easing the process of shopping and paying, winnowing delivery times to a couple days or less, and slashing prices.But the e-commerce giant’s effect on the sector appears to be waning to some extent. Rivals like Walmart and Target have done a lot of catching up, boosting their e-commerce and leveraging their many stores. Independent retailers, including the bookstores that first encountered Amazon as a new competitor, have survived. While Amazon still dominates online sales in the U.S.,with some 40% shareaccording to eMarketer, brick-and-mortar stores still drive85% of all retail sales, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. E-commerce also remains an expensive way to sell products,including at Amazon, which last month warned that profits could vanish in the holiday quarter.In fact, after surging during the height of the pandemic, Amazon’s retail sales floundered all year, and it appears to be scrutinizing its operations. Under new CEO Andy Jassy this year, the companyshuttered mostof its non-grocery physical stores. The company alsocanceled or postponed dozens of warehousesplanned in an expensive expansion of its fulfillment capacity.More recently, Jassy is overseeingmassive layoffsandhiring freezes, much of them in retail. He is said to bereviewing underperforming businessventures like voice assistant Alexa, which reportedly hasfailed to producethe expected volume of orders from users. Founder Jeff Bezos, who until he stepped down last year as chief executive annually penned a letter promising investors that it remained “day one,” might see this new era as “day two.""Amazon now joins other retailers in grappling with how to adjust to the continual evolution in retail. Its tech strength and focus on speed and efficiency are no longer enough to win in this business, according to Doug Stephens, author of “Resurrecting Retail: The Future of Business in a Post-Pandemic World.”“Not only has the retail world closed the gap with Amazon, but the very nature of e-commerce has also fundamentally changed,” Stephens said by email. “Increasingly, retail is not something that resides on static, boring, search-driven websites (like Amazon.com). It now lives inside interesting, entertaining and engaging content and communities of interest. All things Amazon has never been very good at developing.”The customerAmazon has made itself indispensable to legions of consumers, chief among them those paying $140 for its Prime membership. Members get their orders delivered as quickly as one day in some places and enjoy perks like streaming entertainment. But there are some cracks in that formidable base.“Not only has the retail world closed the gap with Amazon, but the very nature of e-commerce has also fundamentally changed.""Doug StephensFounder, Retail ProphetPrime membership looks to be plateauing in the U.S., where penetration has stalled at 77% in the last two years, according to June research from Evercore analysts. The company may have to look abroad to grow Prime, they said.More concerning to analysts are emerging signs of discontent. Amazon remains the most commonly used retail site, with 94% of survey respondents saying they use it, the highest level in eight years, according to Evercore. But those analysts also found satisfaction sliding of late, with 79% of Amazon customers “extremely” or “very satisfied.” That’s a recovery from lower levels during the height of the pandemic, but it’s well below 2013’s 88%, according to the report.Consultancy Brooks Bell uncovered some of the issues. Nearly a third of those surveyed by the firm earlier this year said they got their order late orreceived a low-quality productfrom Amazon at least monthly. Meanwhile 44% said the item they wanted wasn’t in stock at the “everything store,” and 36% said they couldn’t find what they were looking for quickly. And many consumers see better alternatives: Nearly half said they’d rather support small businesses than shop at Amazon, while 36% go elsewhere for product expertise, per Brooks Bell’s report.Evercore attributes the rising level of disappointment to “Amazon’s aggressive expansion of its third-party marketplace to lower-quality international sellers and its increasing rollout of advertising inventory in its product search results” as well as delivery delays.Amazon declined to make anyone available to be interviewed for this story. But in an email the company said it continues to “invest and prioritize creating the best retail experience for customers,” pointing to its October Prime Early Access Sale, which many referred to as asecond Prime Day event. That sale raked in an estimated $8 billion in gross merchandise volume, 25% less than itsJuly Prime Dayandbelow expectations. Amazon also said it just hosted “the biggest holiday shopping weekend ever” over Black Friday and Cyber Monday, although ithasn’t shared specifics.The competitionMost retailers have had to respond to the fierce competition from Amazon over the years, and their efforts have borne fruit.Walmart has borrowed many of Amazon’s ideas, devising a Walmart+ membership with speedy delivery and other benefits, nurturing a third-party marketplace and growing an advertising business, for example.“It took them a long time, but Walmart is now basically copying Amazon's playbook,” Rick Watson, founder and CEO of RMW Commerce Consulting, said by phone. “The only thing that they haven't copied is AWS, which they can't really do. But advertising, fulfillment, marketplace, that's straight out of Amazon’s playbook. They're not really doing anything unique. Their answer is just to wait and see what works at Amazon and copy it. And, look, it seems to be working for them, and they're more profitable right now.”AWS is Amazon’s cloud services unit, a booming tech business that boasts several government and corporate entitiesas clientsand has been consistently more profitable than its retail sales.“It took them a long time, but Walmart is now basically copying Amazon's playbook.""Rick WatsonFounder and CEO, RMW Commerce ConsultingRetailers have responded to the demand for swifter delivery and easy online shopping, as when Target boughthome delivery service Shiptin 2017 to foster omnichannel services anddeveloped its app. But they have also embraced their traditional strengths. Walmart, Target and other chains have leveraged their stores for fulfillment and pickup services, a lesser advantage for Amazon, whose fleet is mostly Whole Foods grocery stores.“Target found its own path,” Watson said. “Everything runs through their stores. I've always been super impressed by what they've done, trying not to copy Amazon.”The physical store itself is a differentiator, and Target and others have made a point of spiffing up their stores, differentiating their merchandise and offering stellar in-person customer service. Independent booksellers — operating in Amazon’s debut retail segment — haveby and large survived, demonstrating that affinity for buying local can outshine Amazon’s convenience and price plays. Amazon in fact has throttled back on non-grocery physical stores,closing all bookstores and 4-star locationsearlier this year.“Clearly, most of these stores in categories such as bookstores lacked elements of innovation or driving in-store engagement or experience,” Euromonitor Senior Consultant Rabia Yasmeen said by email. “Even its grocery stores ... are focused on payment capabilities, cashier less or self-checkout – and still hold room for integrating its online operations with offline presence.”In an email, Amazon said that despite the closures it remains “committed to building great, long-term physical retail experiences and technologies.” The company has opened a couple ofapparel storesthis year, though The Guardian in Julysaid the Los Angeles location“misses the point of shopping.” Watson sees them as potentially effective testing grounds and showcases for their technology, including AI-driven suggestions and smart dressing rooms, but “terrible” venues for selling clothes.The strength from rivals doesn’t just come from the physical landscape, however. On Black Friday this year, Walmart, Target and Kohl’s all outpaced Amazon in online searches for deals, toppling the e-commerce giant from the top spot, though Amazon kept its number-one position on Cyber Monday, according to data from Capitfy.Is this retail?Several experts interviewed for this story pushed back on the idea that Amazon is anywhere close to finished disrupting retail.“Many people look at where Amazon is now and forget that each step they took over the last 20 years to win the customer’s business never made immediate impact to their bottom line,” Forrester Principal Analyst Brendan Witcher said by email. “Amazon has incrementally been building an ecosystem of connections into our lives that will help them better sell to us. Within that strategy is the disruption that is the most impactful because it is almost too hard to see or compete against until it is too late.”Indeed, unlike when itlaunched in 1994as a book e-retailer, most of Amazon’s growth and profit now derives from operations outside its sales of products. Those streams include advertising, third-party seller fees, subscriptions and its cloud business. Last year, the first time it disclosed its advertising revenue, Amazontook in $31.2 billionselling ads, which are featured in its streaming and gaming entertainment and its retail site. Moreover, nearly 60% of the goods sold on its site actuallycome from its third-party seller marketplace.“Amazon has incrementally been building an ecosystem of connections into our lives that will help them better sell to us. Within that strategy is the disruption that is the most impactful because it is almost too hard to see or compete against until it is too late.""Brendan WitcherForrester Principal AnalystStephens notes the company is also building operations in medicine, finance, insurance and education.“If they are successful, that would create an infinitely more lucrative structure than simply pursuing a larger and larger retail marketplace,” he said. “Even a small percentage share of the global healthcare market could rapidly eclipse the value and profitability of Amazon's retail enterprise.”According to Witcher, that proximity to the consumer remains a concern for the industry.“The real competitive advantage Amazon has over Walmart and Target isn’t in their retail capabilities (like how fast they can get us products),” he said. “It is in their ability to sell to us anywhere and anytime as we digitize our lives through our homes, cars, and our mobile interactions.”A host of retailers includingHudson’s Bay,Saks Fifth AvenueandMacy’shave followed Amazon and Walmart in creating marketplaces, while others, including Nordstrom, areboosting revenue with advertising. But how far from retail — the business of merchandising goods to sell to customers — are retailers willing to stray? And how willing are they to continue to compete with a rival able to forgo profits in its retail business?To other analysts, Amazon has only disrupted retail as far as retailers have allowed, which has led them to pursue money-losing endeavors, without the cushion of lucrative side businesses like cloud services or the patience of their investors. Nick Egelanian, president of retail development firm SiteWorks, compares e-commerce to another non-store retail segment, catalogs, which he said contributed 10.9% of retail sales in 1994, the year of Amazon’s founding.“Amazon never disrupted retail any more than Sears and Spiegel did with their catalogs,” he said by email. “But e-commerce is unprofitable under the current model. While Amazon was and is a retail disruption delusion, it did disrupt the mindset and priorities of those who analyze, operate and invest in retail — and continues to do so.”",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-done-disrupting-retail/637430/,True
"As consumers return to stores, why would Amazon shut the door?","Published July 25, 2022","The pandemic supercharged e-commerce as even more consumers discovered its convenience. That led research firm FTI Consulting, for one, tomove up its timelineby three years, to this year, for online sales to handily top $1 trillion.The vast majority of shoppersstill favor stores, however. About three-quarters of consumers prefer them even for ordinary household items, according to consultancy Big Village. Yet in a year when retailers drasticallyeased up on store closuresand Amazon itself saw a3% decline in its Q1 online retailsales, the e-commerce giantclosed all of its bookstores, 4-star stores and pop-ups. The nearly 70 locations — 66 in the U.S., two in the U.K.— were almost the entirety of its non-food fleet. At press time all that remains in that category is a lone, newly opened Amazon Style apparel store.Amazon said by email it closed these stores so it could focus on its other physical retail and tech offerings, and preserve its ability to innovate and scale its business for the long run. But by doing so, it may have lost an opportunity to take full advantage of its own pricing and tech prowess, and could be forfeiting sales in some categories, according to Big Village General Manager David Albert. Bigger picture, the company is withdrawing from a major part of the retail landscape, according toKelly Goetsch, chief strategy officer at headless commerce platform Commercetools.“Even as e-commerce continues to boom, brick-and-mortar locations play a significant role in enabling customers to have an immersive, in-person shopping experience,”Goetschsaid by email. “I believe Amazon’s decision to close its physical locations failed to take this into account, and could possibly impact their business going forward as shoppers move back to physical retail post-pandemic.”Not a retailer?Then again, Amazon’s business is centered around logistics, technology and, increasingly, advertising, and not retail, some experts say. For years now, its third-party marketplace sellers have been responsible for the bulk of the merchandise sold on its site.“Their ability to fulfill the way they do is a pretty amazing feat. That's well understood,” Nick Egelanian, president of retaildevelopmentfirm SiteWorks, said by phone. “I don't think anybody would say they’ve run phenomenal stores. We know that they don't think those stores were so great, because they closed them.”Several observers including Egelanian have described Amazon’s non-grocery stores as unfocused. This was especially true of its 4-star stores, which were merchandised with items selling well on its website, leading to ajumbled assortment of random stuff. And — unlike the manyindependent booksellersthat have survived the price-based disruption unleashed by Amazon a quarter century ago — Amazon’s bookstores werenot curatedin ways that invited browsing or discovery, but instead mainly featured bestsellers.“Warehouse fulfillment is a lot easier than running a retail store because, in retail, you’ve got to be good at the logistics and technology — plus 10 other things,” Egelanian said. “They haven't proven they know how to merchandise, they haven't proven they know how to operate, they haven’t proven they know how to brand, they haven't proven they know how to assort. It’s a lot of ‘not provens.’”GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders in emailed comments noted a dearth of omnichannel options. “Other than some payment technologies, Amazon never really connected its stores and online in the way that many retailers have done,” he said. “Options to order online and pickup from stores, or check stock levels before heading out, were non-existent. This, in our view, was a lost opportunity.”Location choice has also been haphazard, suggesting a lack of understanding of site selection, Egelanian said. Amazon said that a lot goes into deciding where to open a store but declined to elaborate.""It’s not at all clear to me that Amazon has a competitive advantage operating in brick-and-mortar retail.”Kirthi KalyanamProfessor and Executive Director, Retail Management Institute at Santa Clara University’s Leavey School of Business“Every physical store has to have a store model,” Egelanian said. “There's a financial model, but it also needs a demographic model and a physical model — how big is the store? How far does it reach? What is the optimal type of real estate it goes into? What's the optimal number per market? What does it take to make money per market and per management structure? None of those things appeared to be present.”Kirthi Kalyanam, professor and executive director of the Retail Management Institute at Santa Clara University’s Leavey School of Business, agrees that Amazon’score capabilities don’t extend to running brick-and-mortar stores, and isn’t sure the e-commerce giant wants to develop them.”Everything they're good at seems to be very well suited for e-commerce — for running the marketplace, providing fulfillment and delivery for marketplace vendors, providing advertising for marketplace vendors,”Kalyanam said by phone.“It's not at all clear to me that Amazon has a competitive advantage operating in brick-and-mortar retail.”Amazon said by email that physical retail remains an important part of its business, citing one of the most common reasons that other retailers give for getting into e-commerce — to give customers more choices in when, where and how they shop — and that it will continue to open new stores. However, its experiment with brick and mortar is largely over, at least when it comes to most non-grocery goods, because the company sees little reason for it, according toRuss Dieringer, founderof e-commerce research firm Stratably.“They’re satisfied with a pure digital experience in general merchandise categories so long as they can deliver quickly and offer easy return locations,”Dieringersaid.Why stores?While it has nearly wiped out its non-food locations and exited the offline bookselling business, Amazon does run grocery stores and, as of a few months ago, an apparel store.Whole Foods, which the companyacquired in 2017, constitutes the bulk of Amazon’s grocery operations, with more than 500 locations, and it’sexpanding its value-priced Amazon Fresh chain. Aside from Whole Foods, and including locations opening this month, the company runs 85 grocery-oriented stores: 58 Amazon Fresh in the U.S. and U.K. and 27 Amazon Go convenience stores.Each banner, which Amazon said is run independently of the others, increasingly includes technology that collects payment via a mobile appas customers walk outof the store.Why is Amazon so ambitious when it comes to brick and mortar in this segment of retail?Its grocery stores benefit from the retailing talent established at Whole Foods years ago, Egelanian notes.Kalyanam believes that to some extent Amazon is stuck with what was an expensive acquisition.But its grocery, along with itsnew GrubHub partnership, also helps Amazon hone its walk-out payment tech, and delivery beyond its distribution center-based logistics,Kalyanam said. Those could eventually become lucrative in their own right, the way its logistics, advertising and, most dramatically, AWS cloud services have, he said.”They have the e-commerce part of home delivery extremely well nailed,” he said. “They still have to nail high-frequency home delivery — where I order something and get it within an hour. That's typically restaurant, food and all these delivery apps. And at the end of the day, home delivery of groceries is going to be a large delivery business.”What about apparel?In May, Amazon unveiled its firstapparel storeat The Americana at Brand mall in Los Angeles, and has plans for a second in Columbus,Ohio’s Easton Town Center mall. Most of the reasons to expand in grocery probably don’t apply to apparel sales, so it’s not entirely clear why Amazon would venture into brick and mortar in that category after giving up on stores dedicated to books and other merchandise.As with books, the company has grabbed significant share in apparel. Amazon is now the No. 1 seller of clothing in the U.S., exceeding $65 billion, almost double No. 2 Walmart and some 15% of the entire U.S. market, according to a June report from Wells Fargo analysts led by Ike Boruchow. Those analysts expect Amazon to surpass $73 billion in apparel sales this year.The store features technology that provides customers with suggestions based on their preferences, so perhaps that’s in focus. But running a specialty clothing store is even more complicated than other segments due to the vagaries of fashion, according to Egelanian.“Every fashion retailer has to have some kind of a statement,” he said. “What does the Amazon brand do? ‘Amazon Fresh, Amazon Style’? If the idea is to make money in brick-and-mortar retail, they haven’t shown the competency to do that yet. That doesn’t mean they can’t get good at it. But if it's like their other stores, it's going to confuse the customer.”Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly referred to the Amazon Style store as having fit technology. The machine learning at the store has a recommendation engine based on details shared by customers, but doesn't provide assistance with fit beyond such details. This story has also been updated to clarify that, while Amazon has closed all of its stand-alone bookstores and 4-star stores, it sells some non-food items in its grocery and convenience stores.",https://www.retaildive.com/news/Why-amazon-shut-stores/626972/,True
Amazon continues to open suburban Go locations amid store struggles,"Published Feb. 13, 2023","Dive Brief:Amazon will expand its suburban Go c-store concept by opening a new location in Frederickson,  Washington, according to an emailed statement.The store will be Amazon’s second suburban Go location in Washington. The first — marking thedebut of Amazon’s suburban Go format— opened in Mill Creek, Washington last January.The retailer’s newest suburban Go store will be the fourth of its kind to openin a matter of months.

When customers are done shopping, they can leave the store without checking out and receive a receipt while the purchase is charged to their Amazon account.Amazon currently operates 30 Amazon Go c-stores in the U.S. Besides its suburban stores in California and Washington, its urban locations are scattered throughout San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago and New York City.",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-go-opens-31st-c-store/642607/,False
Amazon buys mechatronics firm to fold into robotics division,"Published Sept. 14, 2022","Dive Brief:Amazonsaid last weekit had agreed to buy a Belgium-based supplier for mechatronics equipment, Cloostermans, provided regulatory approval. Amazon did not disclose the terms or timeline for the deal.The two companies began working together in 2019. Since then, Amazon has usedCloostermanstechnology to move and stack heavy pallets and totes, or to help package products at its facilities.The retail giant intends to fold the former supplier and its 200 employees into Amazon Global Robotics. Amazon said in a blog post it intends to focus Cloostermans’ engineering work to “more rapidly deploy solutions” that support employees, improve safety and reduce packaging waste.Dive Insight:Retailers often invest in or purchase robotics equipment tobolster warehouse productivity. For Amazon, the playbook includes acquisitions.The retail giant built its robotics division, Amazon Robotics, off of an acquisition of Kiva Systems in 2012. Since then, the company has used the division toresearch,invest inand acquire fulfillment technology. As of 2022, the company has at least a dozen “types of robotics systems” deployed in its facilities worldwide,according to a blog post.Now, Cloostermans joins the likes of Kiva andCanvas Technologyas robotics companies folded into Amazon, though its technology offerings are broader in scope.As a made-to-order manufacturer, Cloostermans offers more than machinery to Amazon. It also brings manufacturing and assembly capacity, as well as expertise in mechanical and electrical engineering, according to the company’s website. The manufacturer is also a supplier to other companies, such as Procter & Gamble.In its blog post about the deal, Amazon emphasized Cloostermans’ ability to customize, design and manufacture technology. Over the past few years, Amazon has invested more in its technology design capabilities by startingresearch labs in the U.S. and Europeand inventing products like Proteus, afully autonomous mobile robot.“Expanding our design and manufacturing capabilities is just one of the many ways Amazon continues to invest in technologies within our operations,” Amazon said in its blog post.",https://www.retaildive.com/news/Amazon-buys-Cloostermans-mechatronics/631822/,False

The software helps sellers find discounted shipping rates from major carriers such as UPS and FedEx, according to a news release.Sellers will also be able to manage orders across multiple sales channels, not just Amazon, the release said. U.S. merchants will also receive early access to new features Amazon plans on rolling out later this year.Dive Insight:Amazon unveiled a number of new services for sellers as the company works to expand its e-commerce reach.This month, the online retailer announcedfree email marketing capabilitiesto help merchants attract new customers. Amazon also rolled out “Buy with Prime” earlier this year, a program that allows sellers tooffer Prime benefitsincluding free, next-day delivery and free returns on their own online stores.The services present opportunities for sellers to bolster their businesses, streamline inventory management and speed deliveries.

Amazon sued by California on allegations it blocks price competition,"Published Sept. 15, 2022","Dive Brief:California’s attorney generalsued Amazonalleging the company broke state competition laws. Specifically, the suit claims that Amazon keeps prices artificially high via practices barring wholesalers and third-party merchants from offering lower prices to other retailers.“Amazon makes consumers think they are getting the lowest prices possible, when in fact, they cannot get the low prices that would prevail in a freely competitive market because Amazon has coerced and induced its third-party sellers and wholesale suppliers to enter into anticompetitive agreements on price,” the complaint alleges.Ina statementposted online, Amazon responded by saying the lawsuit, were it to be successful, would harm consumers and its sellers.Dive Insight:Since Amazon opened its website to third-party sellerstwo decades ago, Marketplace sales have become a critical and lucrative revenue source in its e-commerce arm. And Amazon has become, by leaps and bounds, the largest and most important channel for third-party sellers online.The lawsuit filed by California Attorney General Rob Bonta alleges that Amazon has used this market power to control pricing not just on its own site but across the market through its contracting practices with merchants and wholesalers.“In these anticompetitive agreements, Amazon’s third-party sellers and wholesale suppliers agree not to offer, and to prevent Amazon’s competitors from offering, lower prices elsewhere — including Walmart.com, Target.com, eBay, their own websites, and other online stores — and incur steep penalties if these other online stores have lower prices,” the complaint states.It goes on to allege that “[c]ompeting sites do not offer lower prices the way they would in a competitive market, not because Amazon competed successfully, not because Amazon is a more efficient retailer and marketplace, but because Amazon forbids it by contract.”The pricing policy, according to the lawsuit, was explicit from 2012 to 2019 in Amazon’s “Pricing Parity Provision” in its agreement with Amazon Marketplace sellers. After the policy came under scrutiny in Congress, Amazon nixed the language.But California’s lawsuit alleges that Amazon still “strictly enforces a de facto retail price parity agreement by imposing escalating penalties on sellers that fail to comply with price parity, until they do comply.”Those penalties, according to the complaint, include disqualifying sellers from winning its “Buy Box” — coveted real estate on Amazon’s site that directs customers directly to purchase — as well as demoting their place in organic search and blocking them from creating new offers.California joins Washington, D.C. in launching a legal challenge against Amazon over its pricing practices with third parties. D.C. Attorney General Karl Raccinesued Amazonlast year over price fixing allegations, pointing to the same conduct. A judge dismissed the district’s lawsuit this year, which Raccine hasappealed.This year, Washington stateshut downthe company’s “Sold by Amazon"" seller program over alleged price fixing.The company has been undergrowing scrutinyover competitive practices for some years, including at the federal level. The House of Representatives in 2020 issued a scathing report on big tech companies that included accusations that Amazonabused its market powerof third-party sellers. One of the attorneys in that investigation nowheads the Federal Trade Commission, which reportedly has investigated numerous aspects of Amazon’s business.Amazon said of California’s lawsuit that the attorney general “fundamentally misunderstands the retail industry and misconstrues Amazon’s practices.” The company added that sellers set their prices and it “makes no effort to prevent them from offering lower prices elsewhere.”In its statement, Amazon did acknowledge that it does not “highlight” seller offerings on its website at prices that are “uncompetitive” compared to other retailers.",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-sued-california-price-competition-allegations/631910/,True

Amazon begins charging for some returns made to The UPS Store,"Published April 12, 2023","Amazon has begun charging customers for some returns made to The UPS Store locations, the company confirmed to sister publication Supply Chain Dive.Customers may be charged when selecting The UPS Store for a return if a free option — Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods and Kohl's locations — is within the same distance or closer to their delivery address.The Informationfirst reported the charge Monday.""We always offer a free option for customers to return their item – if a customer would prefer to return their item at a UPS Store when there is a free option closer to their delivery address, a very small amount of customers may incur a $1 fee,"" spokesperson Steve Kelly said in a statement.The UPS Store has been a key component in Amazon's free returns offering to customers through the years. Amazonsaid last yearthat customers could return eligible items for free at more than 4,768 UPS Store locations.That figure far outnumbers Amazon's other free returns options. Kohl's had1,170 storesas of Jan. 28. Whole Foods has524 U.S. stores, while Amazon Fresh has44 locationstotal.Amazon also ran a program last year allowing customers to use The UPS Store as an option forseller-fulfilled returns. Customers could already make seller-fulfilled returns via the U.S. Postal Service, but Amazon told sellers that the added convenience would encourage shoppers to buy more.Amazon has been adjusting many of its established strategies as it adapts to a slowdown in demand.

Amazon's new analytics tool gives brands a front-row seat to in-store shopping,"Published July 6, 2022","Dive Brief:Amazon launched its newest analytic tool, Store Analytics, which provides anonymous and aggregated data about which products shoppers are discovering, considering and purchasing to brands to help improve in-store performance and marketing,according to a press release.Store Analytics shares shopping behavior in U.S. Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh locations that utilize Just Walk Out technology, which tracks items that customers walk out with so they can skip checkout lines, and Amazon Dash Cart, a smart-cart that tracks what goes in and out of shoppers’ carts and charges them accordingly from the cart itself.The data shared is stored securely in the cloud and doesn’t include personal information, but instead includes details like offer totals, averages and percentages about product and promotion performance. Shoppers can opt out at any time.Dive Insight:Amazon’s launch of its newest tool, Store Analytics, gives marketers specific insights, including how often shoppers put products back onto shelves, and arrives as brands are scrambling for ways to learn more about consumer behavior. The information from in-store shoppers could help marketers optimize their in-store marketing, including digital signage, by enabling them to experiment with more carefully curated selling tactics based on the success of promotions, availability and placement.Tapping into in-store data could seem like a pre-pandemic move, but in-person shopping may be making a comeback. While COVID-19 forced many brands to ramp up digital efforts, a report released by Mastercard in May showedpeople may be tired of shopping via the web, with online sales growing just 2.2% compared to the same period last year, compared with in-person sales, which grew 13.4%.Amazon, in its announcement for Store Analytics, addressed privacy concerns,which have grown monumentally in recent years. The e-commerce behemoth said that shopper data is stored securely in the cloud and all personal information is withheld from brands, upholding that the only accessible data will be how well products and promotions are performing in select time periods in the sum of averages and percentages. Notice of the ability for consumers to opt out is given via email receipts and in-store signage.The newly introduced Store Analytics capitalizes on other technological advances by the company including Amazon Dash Cart and Just Walk Out, two features that track in-person consumer behavior and exist only at participating Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh locations in the U.S.,which total less than 100. Store Analytics will take the data gathered from those services, monitoring the consumer shopping experience from start to finish, and aggregate it before allowing brands to access it.Introducing Store Analytics is one of many efforts Amazon has made recently to meet the needs of marketers. In November 2021 at its annual Unboxed showcase, Amazon revealedits new measurement solution Brand Metrics, which quantifies various engagement tactics, and an Amazon Brand Lift tool, which helps brands track marketing objectives using the Amazon Shopper Panel.The recent push to further support brands follows Amazon’s recent Q1 report, which revealed thecompany fell short of analyst expectationsin its advertising segment, despite meeting overall revenue targets.

Amazon targets counterfeits with new information-sharing exchange,"Published April 25, 2023","Dive Brief:Amazon unveileda new information-sharing platformThursday aimed at helping retailers track counterfeiters and stop sales of online fakes.Dubbed the Anti-Counterfeiting Exchange (ACX), the e-commerce giant described the platform as “an industry collaboration” designed to make it more difficult for counterfeiters to “move among different stores to attempt to sell their counterfeit goods.”Amazon said it has already found hundreds of instances through ACX where the same counterfeiter tried to create accounts on Amazon and at least one other store operator.Dive Insight:Counterfeit goodshave long dogged Amazon and other online marketplaces, which rely on a vast pool of sellers to procure products and sell goods through their own independent businesses. Amazon’s massive stable ofnearly two million sellersmakes its website a money-making machine, and also incredibly difficult to vet for bad actors.For years, a chorus of brands large and small voiced frustration against Amazon over the proliferation of fakes, in some cases takinglegal action. The American Apparel & Footwear association even pushed for Amazon’s platform to be listed by the U.S. Trade Representative as a“notorious market” for counterfeits. (The trade office in past years has included some ofAmazon’s overseas websites on the list, sparking pushback from Amazon.)Since launching its Brand Registry in 2017, Amazon says it hasstopped 800,000 “bad actor attempts”at creating new selling accounts through its platform and identified six million counterfeit items. Over the years, Amazon has alsoteamed up with brandsto pursue counterfeiters in court.ACX represents a front in the battle against counterfeits. Users on the platform can share information about confirmed counterfeiters with each other, and a third-party anonymizes access for participants sharing and receiving information.Amazon said in a press release that “participants can identify and stop perpetrators more quickly than they would in the absence of this collaborative data sharing.” Users can learn immediately when one of their peers has flagged a counterfeiter and make decisions independently about whether to stop using the seller in their store.“This is an opening salvo in a much larger battle against counterfeiters and criminal organizations, and the effort will need even greater participation, from all industries and sectors, to reach its full potential,” James Mancuso, director of the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center — a government entity led by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — said in a statement included in Amazon’s announcement.Amazon said it has been working with ACX members to pilot and ensure guardrails of the exchange.

"Amazon reportedly plans 10K layoffs, with a focus on retail","Published Nov. 14, 2022","Dive Brief:Amazon plans to lay off as many as 10,000 employees, starting this week, with afocus on its retail operationsand device division including Alexa, as well as human resources, the New York Times reported Monday.The scope of the layoffs, if it remains around that number, reflects about 3% of its corporate workforce and less than 1% of its global workforce, according to the Times report.Amazon didn’t immediately return a request for comment.Dive Insight:Amazon has previously said it is pausing hiring,first in its retailoperations andthen company-wide, in the face of an uncertain macroeconomic environment. More recently, the company was reportedly scrutinizing unprofitable divisions,also encompassing its retail divisionas well as Alexa, the device once seen as capable of expanding its product sales. Now, hiring freezes appear to be morphing into actual downsizing.Two years ago many analysts already viewed smart device features like Alexa asfailing to meet expectationsfor driving purchases in light of consumer hesitations. The voice assistant is routinely drafted to coax holiday shoppers to buy, and Amazon again this year saidAlexa users can access its 48-hour Black Friday sales eventstarting Nov. 24 by asking, “Alexa, what are my deals?” The devices are also offered at deep discounts at the holidays, and this year the company’s Alexa-enabled Echo machines will be up to 70% off, according to a Monday release from Amazon.Amazon joins several tech companies including Facebook owner Meta, Twitter and others that have also announced significant layoffs in recent days. At Amazon, the focus on retail is unsurprising in light of the fact that its primary revenue growth drivers are advertising, subscriptions, logistics and itsAWScloud serviceand not retail sales of goods.

Amazon slows network expansion in response to cooling customer demand,"Published Aug. 3, 2022","Dive Brief:Amazon has slowed its operations expansion plans for this year and 2023 ""to better align with expected customer demand,"" CFO Brian Olsavsky said on the e-commerce giant'sQ2 earnings call Thursday.A glut in fulfillment capacity was part of the$6 billion in added coststhe company saw in Q1, along with inflationary pressures and less productive warehouses. The company has since made progress in reducing those costs, which settled in at $4 billion in Q2. Olsavsky said that was in line with Amazon's expectations.""We expect fixed cost leverage to improve in the second half of the year as we continue to grow into our capacity,"" Olsavsky said. ""We've also taken steps to slow future network capacity additions.""Dive Insight:Amazon had accelerated the growth of its distribution network to meet heightened demand in 2021, with fulfillment and transportation capacity being the focus of more than half of its total capital investments, according to Olsavsky. Now, the company is slowing supply chain investments as it sees slowing revenue growth and declining sales.Net sales at Amazon’s online storesfell 4% year over year. The company expects 40% of capital investments this year to be focused on warehouse or transportation capacity, down from 55% in 2021.“We expect the fulfillment and transportation dollars spent on capital projects to be lower in 2022 versus the prior year,"" Olsavsky said.Amazon also saw a $2 billion net loss in the quarter following a $3.9 billion pre-tax valuation loss from its investment in Rivian, which is producing100,000 custom-made delivery vehiclesfor Amazon.A strong fulfillment network is still a critical component of Amazon's business. Olsavsky noted that third-party sellers represented a record 57% of all units sold on Amazon in Q2 and that ""Fulfillment by Amazon provides sellers the ability to offer fast delivery."" The company saw a quarter-over-quarter improvement in delivery speed, he added.Amazon has also grappled with excess employees in its fulfillment network. The company hired additional workers to fill in for those sidelined by the omicron variant earlier this year, but warehouses became overstaffed after the variant's spread subsided. Amazon adjusted staffing levels in Q2, Olsavsky said; the company's employee headcountfell 6%from the previous quarter.""I would note that we're still up 188,000 [employees] year over year and nearly double the headcount of what we had heading into the pandemic in early 2020,"" Olsavsky said.",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-slows-warehouse-network-expansion-cooling-demand/628665/,True
Amazon pursues in-game shopping with Amazon Anywhere,"Published May 10, 2023","Dive Brief:Looking to bolster smooth in-app purchases, Amazon has debuted Amazon Anywhere, a new shopping tool that allows users to make purchases within games and apps,the retailer announced on Tuesday. The tool is launching within Peridot, an augmented reality adventure pet game.Amazon Anywhere enables shoppers to see relevant products, for example Peridot-branded merchandise, within a selected game or app, and access product details, images, prices, estimated delivery date and other information. Shoppers can buy their desired items without leaving the game, once they connect their Amazon account to the chosen app.Developers can also use Amazon Anywhere to curate a selection of goods for shoppers to buy within games and apps. Fulfillment and delivery of the products are handled by Amazon.Dive Insight:In its quest to improve in-game shopping, Amazon tapped Niantic, which developed the Pokémon Go game, as its first partner. But the retailer noted in its blog post that the tool can be used more broadly for video games, mobile apps and virtual worlds.“We’re creating a new landscape for shoppable entertainment and digital experiences while continuing to meet our customers where they are, with the products they love,” Steve Downer, vice president of consumer electronics at Amazon, wrote in a company blog post. “Most shopping in virtual worlds is currently limited to purchases of virtual currency and in-game digital items, with no easy path to purchase physical products. We want to change that.”Amazon has worked in other ways to improve the in-app buying experience of its products. Last year, the retailerrolled out a virtual shoe try-on featurein its shopping app to help consumers visualize products from the brands it sells. In November, the companybegan using Snapchat’s Shopping Lenses, allowing Snapchat users to try on glasses from thousands of eyewear brands sold at Amazon Fashion digitally.Much like Amazon Anywhere, Snap offers its shopping tools to businesses to improve their digital shopping experience. Earlier this year, the companyunveiled its AR Enterprise Services arm, which allows companies to add Snap’s AR technology to their own operations, including its 3D Viewer, AR Try-On and Fit Finder tools. PerSnap’s survey findings released in April 2022, 92% of Gen Z shoppers want to use AR technology for online shopping.",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-anywhere-mobile-video-game-shopping-peridot/649897/,False
Amazon is scaling back private label business: WSJ,"Published July 15, 2022","Dive Brief:Amazon has been “drastically”cutting back the number of items it sellsunder its private label brands, according to a Wall Street Journal report that cited anonymous sources.According to the Journal, Amazon leaders over the past six months have told the private label team to reduce items and not reorder amid disappointing sales andantitrust scrutinyby enforcers and Congress.The e-commerce giant, the Journal also reported, has even considered exiting its private label business. “We never seriously considered closing our private label business and we continue to invest in this area, just as our many retail competitors have done for decades and continue to do today,” Amazon said in a statement to Retail Dive.Dive Insight:Amazon’s private label business for years has been the subject of hype, speculation, fear, measurement and governmental scrutiny.In the latter case, Congressional investigators framed Amazon’s own brands as a conflict of interest for the company, which both operates a massive e-commerce platform for third-party sellers and brands, as well as owns its own brands which often compete with others selling on its site.Members of a House of Representatives subcommittee scrutinizing big tech companies have more recently accused Amazon executives of lying about whether the company has used specific data from other brands on its platform in its own private label business, and whether it prioritizes its own brands in its web search algorithms. In March, the House of Representative’s Judiciary committeereferred the matterto the Justice Department.For its part, Amazon has pushed back on the premise that its interests were in conflict with those of sellers and brands that use its marketplace platform. “Amazon and third-party sellers have a mutually beneficial relationship, and our interests are well aligned,” the company said in 2020, after a scathing House report was released. That same House investigation found that inside Amazon, sellers were referred to as “internal competitors.”Even if the company gains an advantage from seller data, Amazon’s private labels have not necessarily dominated its site. Marketplace Pulse has found that in some categories Amazon’s private labelsrepresent less than 1% of sales. The biggest exception from that research was apparel, which Marketplace Pulse found to represent 9% of Amazon’s sales.In the Journal’s account, Amazon has been trying to refocus around its most popular private label products, similar to the strategies of fellow retail giants Walmart and Target, after the e-commerce specialist in past years worked tobroadenanddiversifyits private label goods.",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-scaling-back-private-label-business/627373/,False
Amazon extends UPS as option for seller-fulfilled returns,"Published Oct. 20, 2022","Dive Brief:Amazon has extended the use of UPS as a customer option for seller-fulfilled returns, according toa company announcementlast week. Originally running from Sept. 5 to Oct. 2, the choice is now available until Nov. 1.When it announced the ""short-term experiment"" in August, Amazon told sellers that providing customers with the convenience to drop off their return at a UPS store would encourage them to buy more. Customers could already send seller-fulfilled returns through the U.S. Postal Service.Amazon said last week it will automatically reimburse the cost difference between UPS and USPS shipping labels. Some sellers had complained that customers returning shipments via UPS would cost more.Dive Insight:Amazon’s extension of the UPS option for seller-fulfilled returns underscores the two companies’ enduring ties, even as UPS reduces the share of its revenue from the online retail giant.Beyond its status as UPS' largest customer, Amazon is also a notable driver of returns made through the parcel carrier. That was the case before Amazon rolled out the new option for seller-fulfilled returns — customers can return eligible items for free at more than 4,768 UPS Store locations, Amazon noted in a Januaryblog post.UPS Store locations are a crucial piece in Amazon's current returns processing approach, as “nobody does returns better,” wrote Dean Maciuba, managing partner USA at Crossroads Parcel Consulting,in a LinkedIn post.""UPS could choose to leverage this service offering to Amazon if the [e-commerce] giant should decide to pull the plug on UPS deliveries, and UPS wants to keep Amazon deliveries in the network,"" Maciuba wrote.Amazon has made up a smaller share of UPS' total revenue since it aggressively expanded its own logistics network to keep up with pandemic-fueled demand. The company was tied to 11.7% of UPS' total revenue in 2021, down from 13.3% in 2020, according toa securities filingfrom the parcel carrier.""We've contractually agreed on what makes sense for us versus what makes sense for them,"" UPS CEO Carol Tomé saidon a July earnings callof the relationship between the two companies. ""That means both volume and revenue for Amazon is coming down.""Tomé said UPS projects Amazon revenue will be less than 11% of total revenue by the end of this year as the company continues its ""better, not bigger"" approach that prioritizes more profitable shipments.Amazon's new, experimental UPS returns option specifically applies to items under its Prepaid Returns Label program.Through the program, Amazon sends customers a prepaid return shipping label on the seller's behalf if a customer requests a return within the allowable time period,according to EcomCrew, a blog run by online store owners. Sellers who fulfill their own Amazon orders, rather than using the company's own fulfillment services, are automatically enrolled in this program.Most third-party sellers on Amazon have a returns policy mirroring what the company offers, but they can still vary,according to the company's website.

Amazon to spend nearly $1B on wage hikes for frontline workers,"Published Sept. 29, 2022","Dive Brief:Amazon plans tospend nearly $1 billionon pay increases for its frontline workers in the U.S., the company said in a press release.With pay increases starting in October, the average starting wage for employees in its customer fulfillment and transportation operations will go from $18 to more than $19, Amazon said. (The full range runs from $16 to $26 per hour, depending on position and location.)Amazon has also expanded a program dubbed “Anytime Pay” that allows instant and flexible access of up to 70% of eligible earned pay rather than relegating pay to a weekly or bi-weekly schedule.Dive Insight:With the cost of living on the rise, retailers will likely come under pressure to increase wages for workers, who over the past two and a half years have shouldered many of the burdens of pandemic-era operations, from social distancing to out-of-stocks.Amazon in particular has set out to become “Earth’s Best Employer.” That comes after complaints about working conditions in its facilities have long dogged the company. This year,an Amazon fulfillment centerin Staten Island unionized — the first in the company’s nearly 30 year history — and others have voted or moved to vote.Amazon hasargued against unionsas “the best answer” for its workers while trying to position itself as a world-class employer. Meanwhile, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, one of the country’s largest labor groups, hasset up a divisiondedicated solely to organizing Amazon workers. In doing so, the union claimed Amazon was responsible for half of all workplace injuries in the warehouse sector and said that “we refuse to allow Amazon to continue to abuse and disrespect the more than one million Americans it employs.”It’s not for nothing that workers at Amazon and other retail companies are looking to organize. Union representation tends to increase wages for the retail workers. Weekly pay in 2021 was$24 higherfor those in the retail trade represented by unions than nonunion workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Many retail wages have also been pushed up byhigher minimum wagesat the regional and state levels. Along with the benefits to workers, research has found that, for businesses, higher wages can yield increased labor from workers, cost savings from reduced turnover and productivity gains.Amazon framed its wage increases as an investment in its workers and its relationship with them. “Continuing to invest in pay, providing easy access to earned wages at any time during the month, and offering great benefits and career advancement opportunities are all part of our long-term efforts to be the best employer in the world,” John Felton, senior vice president of Amazon’s worldwide operations, said in the release.Amazon has also added partners to its education benefit for employees and made a development program that trains workers for engineering roles in its Amazon Web Services business.",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-spend-1-billion-wage-hikes-frontline-workers/632939/,True
Amazon pulls back from UPS as it builds out logistics empire,"Published March 6, 2023","UPS plans to further reduce its business with top customer Amazon in 2023, even as both companies face obstacles that could complicate their mutually agreed cutback.Amazon is shifting away from UPS and other carriers as it works to build its own logistics empire, in part to gain greater control over transit times and the end-customer's delivery experience. Meanwhile, UPS has chased growth in segments outside of e-commerce in order to boost its profit margins.Estimates from MWPVL International, a firm tracking Amazon's growth, demonstrates the impact of both companies' respective evolutions. The number of Amazon packages UPS handled in 2022 was 1.3 billion, down from 1.41 billion the year before.""We're just starting to see a slight decline in the absolute package volume,"" Marc Wulfraat, MWPVL president and founder, said. ""Prior to that it was always growing, because the total volume of packages was growing … Now Amazon's got such a large scope of coverage that they can do [it] themselves.”Amazon-related revenue falls as UPS refocusesUPS' revenue tied to Amazon fell from 13.3% in 2020 to 11.3% in 2022,according to a UPS securities filing. Cowen analysts said in a January note that the 2022 percentage would have been lower, barring a $1.3-billion currency impact from a strong U.S. dollar.Although Amazon-related revenue jumped in 2020 as the e-commerce giant scrambled to meet demand at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, it declined over the following two years as UPS began to focus on attracting more profitable deliveries from healthcare companies and smaller shippers.Share of UPS revenue tied to Amazon shrinksPercentage of UPS consolidated revenues represented by Amazon, since 2019""We look favorably on their ongoing efforts to manage down the percent of low margin B2C business that they are willing to take,"" Cowen analysts said of UPS' efforts to reduce its share of Amazon-related revenue.The decline in Amazon business is affecting more than just revenue. In Q4, UPS' average daily U.S. domestic volume fell 3.8% YoY, with about half of that drop coming from Amazon, CFO Brian Newman said on aJan. 31 earnings call. The companies planned for that decline through a previously arranged contractual agreement, he added.UPS expects the volume decline in its U.S. segment to continue this year, fueled by Amazon insourcing more of its own deliveries, Newman said. He noted that growth from other customers will nearly offset the drop.""We'll continue on a mutually agreed path to glide that business down in 2023,"" Newman said of Amazon.A reduction in the amount of business UPS does with Amazon isn't necessarily a bad thing for the carrier, since it's a prepared decline as opposed to an unexpected drop, LPF Spend Management founder Nate Skiver saidin a LinkedIn post. He added that UPS can recapture lost revenue with fewer packages by leaning on higher-yielding shipments from smaller businesses.Amazon builds a network to rival UPSWhile UPS' priorities have shifted, Amazon's capabilities have transformed.The e-commerce giant leverages UPS in instances where capacity constraints limit its ability to move packages itself, Wulfraat said. The company also needs UPS to deliver in areas where Amazon's sprawling network of logistics facilities hasn't yet reached.""There's no fulfillment center or sortation center or delivery station operated by Amazon anywhere close to Billings, Montana,"" Wulfraat said. ""So let's say the order that you're placing happens to be coming from the Phoenix fulfillment center. The only way that Amazon can get that merchandise to the customer in two days is to leverage the resources of UPS.""Still, Amazon'saggressive buildoutof sortation centers, delivery stations and transportation infrastructure has allowed it to deliver significantly more parcels in-house overall. The company's market share for U.S. parcel volumes grew to 22% in 2021, beating out UPS rival FedEx, according to the Pitney Bowes Parcel Shipping Index.Amazon's market share grows to rival top carriersMarket share of U.S. parcel volume, 2014 to 2021""We took a fulfillment center footprint that we've built over 25 years and doubled it in just a couple of years,"" Amazon President and CEO Andy Jassy saidon a Feb. 2 earnings call. ""And then we, at the same time, built out a transportation network for last mile roughly the size of UPS in a couple of years.""Amazon's pullback, weak demand could slow the splitTwo factors could complicate Amazon's planned reduction of UPS business, according to experts.Amazon has closed several warehouses and canceled plans for future facilities in recent months as the company attempts to trim its operating expenses. This pullback in its logistics buildout could lead Amazon to have an equal or greater reliance on UPS compared to last year, Wulfraat said.Possible relief in parcel rates could also weigh on Amazon's use of UPS. Pricing power is slowly shifting back in favor of shippersas demand softens, following years of capacity constraints and added fees.Pricing has always been at top of mind for Amazon when it comes to transportation, and the company will pursue the lowest-cost option whether it's in-house or through a third party, said Shipium co-founder and CEO Jason Murray, who was the former vice president of supply chain and retail services at Amazon. It's in Amazon's best interest to maintain its relationship with UPS ""and have them essentially as a backup.""""If they see softness in UPS' demand and cost structure, they will jump on that and bring down their own cost structure by taking advantage of that,"" Murray said of Amazon.",https://www.retaildive.com/news/ups-amazon-reduce-delivery-volume-revenue-ties-2023/644199/,True
Amazon says it is 'inappropriately' targeted by big tech legislation,"Published June 1, 2022","Dive Brief:Amazon lashed out at Congress and defended its business practices in ablog posttied to proposed legislation that aims to prevent abuses and reduce conflicts of interest among the largest platform companies, including Amazon, Google and Facebook.In the post, Brian Huseman, Amazon vice president of public policy, said that if turned into law it could force the company to allow other logistics providers to service Prime orders sold by third-party sellers.Huseman also complained that because the bill applies to those companies with market caps of more than half a trillion dollars, along with other criteria, it ""inappropriately"" is ""targeted at only one U.S. retailer — Amazon.""Dive Insight:Shifting attitudes around antitrust issues in both major U.S. political parties has been aheadache for Amazonthat has only grown with time and the company's size. The big tech legislation introduced in both theSenateandHouse of Representativesis just the latest potential salvo in various run-ins between the company and government.In Huseman's post, and in past statements by the company and executives, Amazon has maintained that its market should be viewed as the same as other mass merchants and retailers. Viewed by all the categories it sells in, the company that has long aimed to be the ""everything store"" has a relatively small share of the total retail market, of which e-commerce is still just a fraction. That also makes it, Huseman argued, different from the other tech companies targeted in the bill.""In reality, Amazon’s Consumer business (which this proposed legislation is largely aimed at) has much more in common with thousands of other retailers, like Walmart, Target, and Costco, all of which would be mysteriously excluded from the bill’s proposed regulations,"" Huseman wrote.In e-commerce and online marketplaces, Amazon's dominance is well-established and seemingly invincible despite the billions of dollars invested by Walmart, Target and other retailers. Amazon as a whole is set tocapture nearly 40% of the e-commerce marketin 2022, or $2 of every $5 spent, according to eMarketer. The next 14 largest digital retailers are left to divvy up another 31%, with the entire rest of the internet retailing universe making up the balance of share.According to Marketplace Pulse, Amazon’s third-party marketplace accounts for25% of all e-commercein the U.S. In terms of traffic,visits to Amazonwere nearly triple those of its next closest marketplace rival, eBay, and more than five times the visits to No. 3 Walmart, according to Statista data.Huseman also focused on the consumer benefits to Amazon's platform and operations. ""Prime is much more than a membership program — it’s become a service people love and rely on,"" Huseman wrote. Fulfillment by Amazon, the company's internal logistics service, allows its third-party sellers to offer products with Amazon's two-day delivery promise for Prime.""Sen. [Amy] Klobuchar’s vaguely worded bill would mandate that Amazon allow other logistics providers to fulfill Prime orders,"" Huseman wrote, adding that Amazon has tried to allow outside logistics providers to fulfill Prime orders but ""unfortunately, these providers were not able to consistently deliver in the timeframes Prime customers have come to expect.""The legislation under consideration follows a long investigation into Amazon and other dominant tech platforms, the resulting report of which accused Amazon ofexploiting seller dataand other abuses of its market power in online commerce.Earlier this year, the Housereferred Amazon to the Department of Justiceon allegations that executives lied about the company’s use of seller data and “manipulation of consumers’ search results” during the House investigation.

Amazon expands ‘Buy with Prime’ to all US merchants,"Published Jan. 10, 2023","Dive Brief:Amazon willexpand “Buy with Prime” to all U.S. merchants by Jan. 31, allowing Prime members to shop on outside websites, using their saved checkout details and accessing Prime benefits like free delivery and returns. The optionlaunched in Aprillast year by invitation only.The e-commerce giant also launched Reviews from Amazon, enabling merchants to display ratings and reviews from Amazon customers on their own sites for no additional cost, per a company press release.Software-as-a-service e-commerce platform BigCommerce on Tuesday said it willintegrate the Buy with Prime appin the first quarter, allowing its merchants to add the option without coding.Dive Insight:As Amazonscales back its retail operationsto some extent, it’s looking outside for opportunities to expand.Clicking a button to “buy with Prime” theoretically expands the suite of perks and conveniences available to Prime members. But the e-commerce company is pitching the program to U.S. merchants, including those that don’t necessarily sell through the Amazon marketplace. On Tuesday Amazon said its Buy with Prime program “has been shown to increase shopper conversion by an average of 25%.”“We’ve been working closely with merchants since the launch of Buy with Prime and have been thrilled to hear the results it’s helped drive for them so far,” Peter Larsen, Amazon vice president of Buy with Prime, said in a statement. “We’ll continue innovating and investing in new features, such as Reviews from Amazon, to help merchants of all sizes succeed and give Prime members the shopping benefits they love, whether it’s on Amazon or beyond.”Despite the expansion announced Tuesday, Amazon likely understands that it could take a few years to know if it will scale, according to Rick Watson, founder and CEO of RMW Commerce Consulting.“At the end of the day, it's not going to be meaningful for some time, because this is such a small program,” Watson said by phone. “There's something like a thousand sellers every day that joined the Amazon marketplace last year. How many are going to join with Buy with Prime every day this year? Not nearly that many.”Like Amazon Pay, which has shown up as apayment optionon some websites for over a decade, the Buy with Prime button is something of a time saver for customers because their payment and shipping details are automatically available, but it’s “not terribly unique,” according to Watson.Moreover, even some of the merchants touted in Amazon’s press materials Tuesday don’t apply the Buy with Prime option to every product they sell, he said. That introduces pain points for customers, who want to easily see shipping options and costs.“If you look at the history of direct e-commerce, I don't think that's going to work at scale, and I think that will limit the success of the program,” he said. “And so, what percentage of merchants will let Buy with Prime have run of site? That is a question that they need to answer.”",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-expands-buy-with-prime-us/640037/,False
Amazon expands email marketing tools for brands seeking new customers,"Published Sept. 16, 2022","Dive Brief:Amazon is enabling merchants to send email marketing messages to a wider swath of customers through a Tailored Audiences toolunveiled at its Accelerate conference.The idea is to help sellers reach loyal, high-spending and new shoppers beyond those that choose to follow their pages. The platform will help brands track email performance metrics such as click-through rates, delivery rates, opt-out rates, sales and conversions.Tailored Audiences is currently in beta but Amazon said the program, which is available at no cost through its Seller Central portal, will go wide to U.S. sellers early next year. Opening channels for sellers to market directly to customers comes as Amazon contends with cooling e-commerce growth and makes a bigger push into digital advertising.Dive Insight:Amazon is expanding email marketing capabilities for sellers to help them foster stronger loyalty and attract new shoppers into the fold. While Tailored Audiences won’t be widely available in the U.S. until next year, the beta comes as marketers lock in their holiday strategies, which could provide fertile testing ground ahead of the rollout. The tool was one of severalmarketing-related announcements made at Acceleratethis week.Consumers have previously been able to “follow” their preferred brands on Amazon to receive notifications about special deals and shopping eventsthrough a Brand Follow feature. Tailored Audiences lets sellers send similar email messages to a broader set of customers for the first time.The offering is a response to a desire expressed among brands to “increase customer lifetime value,” Amazon executives said. Amazon is expected to capture nearly40% of e-commerce sales in the U.S. this year, a double-edged sword for merchants that account for more than half of its physical product sales but need to stand out in a growing sea of goods.The platform haslong had a complicated relationship with sellers, and Tailored Audiences could be a way to win favor with the third parties that keep its e-commerce juggernaut chugging. It could alsofrustrate customers who don’t necessarily want emailspiling up in their inbox.Along with making the email marketing perk free, the e-commerce giant plans to roll out custom HTML content and more robust templates to help campaigns pop.“With these capabilities, Amazon is helping to put more control into the hands of brands around how they market to their customers,” said James Gossling, director of e-commerce at Sports Research, in a statement attached to the news. “These email marketing capabilities are exactly what we’re looking for to keep our customers coming back.”Amazon has recently introduced other ways for sellers to gussy up their presence on its site. The company pointed to a Premium A+ Content tool that allows merchants to integrate richer media modules, including video, image carousels and Q&As, into product pages. Brands using the feature have seen sales increase by up to 20%, according to Amazon.However, the broader e-commerce business is slowing following a frenzy earlier in the pandemic. Online retail sales at Amazondipped 4% year over year in the second quarter to $50.86 billion, the second straight quarter of declines.

Amazon cited for safety violations at 3 more warehouses,"Published Feb. 6, 2023","Dive Brief:Federal safety inspectors on Wednesdaycited Amazonon workplace violations forthe second timein less than a month, alleging the e-commerce giant failed to keep workers safe at three additional warehouses.The Occupational Safety and Health Administration said Amazon exposed workers to a high risk of low back injuries and other musculoskeletal disorders at warehouses in Aurora, Colorado; Nampa, Idaho; and Castleton, New York.Amazon faces $46,875 in proposed penalties. The company is also under investigation for similar violations at six other warehouses, and faces a proposed fine of $60,269.Dive Insight:Inspectors say warehouse workers were subjected to long hours and often had to twist or bend in awkward positions to lift items. A review of on-site injury logs confirmed workers experienced high rates of musculoskeletal disorders, OSHA said.""Amazon's operating methods are creating hazardous work conditions and processes, leading to serious worker injuries,"" explained Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health Doug Parker. ""They need to take these injuries seriously and implement a company-wide strategy to protect their employees from these well-known and preventable hazards.""Amazon intends to appeal the citations.Kelly Nantel, a spokesperson for the e-commerce giant, said that the company has reduced injury rates in the U.S. by nearly 15% between 2019 and 2021.“We take the safety and health of our employees very seriously, and we don’t believe the government’s allegations reflect the reality of safety at our sites,” she said in a statement to Supply Chain Dive.The investigation into the Aurora, Nampa and Castleton facilities began in August 2022, shortly after OSHA began inspecting six other warehouses for similar workplace injury violations. In December, the agency said it would fine Amazon nearly $30,000 for violations including failing to record, or in some cases misclassifying, injuries and illnesses.Musculoskeletal disorders are some of the most common workplace injuries across industries. A report published from acoalition of labor unionslast spring analyzed OSHA data and found that the injury rate at Amazon warehouses was twice that of non-Amazon warehouses.Last June, Amazon signed on to a National Safety Council pledge to reduce musculoskeletal disorder injuries25% by 2025.

Earlier this year the company closed all of its bookstores, 4-Star stores and pop-ups, leaving only its grocery stores, convenience stores and an apparel store.Expanding Amazon’s same-day delivery service to include other brands is a way to offer Amazon customers “greater selection, at faster speeds,"" Sarah Mathew, director of Amazon Delivery Experience, said in a statement.Its recenttie-up with GrubHubis a further indication of the company’s interest in speedy, last-mile delivery.Monday’s agreement with Pacsun, GNC and others is also the latest example of Amazon’s evolution into less of a retailer and more of a provider of services, including cloud computing, fulfillment and other logistics, and advertising. In its most recent quarter, Amazon saw revenue growth in those areas, while itsonline retail sales fellfor the second straight quarter.Amazon has previously partnered with other retailers’ brick-and-mortar stores. For a few years now, for example, Kohl’s has taken Amazon returns at all of its brick-and-mortar stores, which the department store has said helps drive footfall.Brands have taken different approaches to partnering with Amazon, with some avoiding it in order to maintain control of their own marketing, data and merchandising, and others seeing it as a way to connect with Amazon’s vast customer base.

It moves items prior to packaging, relieving employees of repetitive tasks.Sparrow is currently in the research and development phase, and the company is weighing several factors before deploying it at scale, spokesperson Xavier Van Chau said in an email.Dive Insight:Amazon workers picked, stowed or packed more than 13 million packages per day last year. With Sparrow, Amazon aims to make the fulfillment process more efficient through automation.Maximizing such efficiencies is particularly important after the company overextended its fulfillment network and becameweighed down with added costs.""Robotics technology enables us to work smarter, not harder, to operate efficiently and safely,"" Amazon said in its announcement of Sparrow.The company prioritized automation well before its more recent issues, however. The acquisition of Kiva Systems in 2012 kickstarted a larger robotics presence within its facilities to help handle waves of customer orders.As of June, the company had more than 520,000 robotic drive units and more than a dozen types of robotic systems in its facilities.“We have millions of products of all shapes and sizes in our inventory, and we recognized the opportunity to invent new technology that could help handle them at Amazon’s scale,” Amazon said.Sparrow is expected to complement the other machines in the company's network. Once items are handled by Sparrow and then packaged, existing robotic arms likeRobinandCardinalcan redirect them within the warehouse ahead of delivery.Robotic parcel sorters have been an investment area for companies beyond Amazon.

Amazon hopes to ultimately employ 500 at the center to maximize the facility’s capacity.“It’s a privilege to further our investment in Liberty to meet the growing customer demand for larger items in the Kansas City metro, while also creating career opportunities for the community,” said Site Leader Jyoti Sharma.The big-and-bulky facility typically handles items longer than 96 inches or greater than 50 pounds, such as furniture, TVs and exercise equipment.An Amazon spokesperson told Supply Chain Dive that the e-commerce giant operates dozens of delivery stations and fulfillment centers dedicated to “extra large” items. In 2017,Amazon transportedits first shipment from its warehouse in Livonia, Michigan, which specializes in oversized items.The new facility comes as Amazon shifts to aregional fulfillment modelto cut costs and remove complexities associated with operating a national network. The company recently overhauled its inventory placement strategy to position goods closer to end customers.Other companies includingInstacartandMaerskhave also launched big-and-bulky services as a way to expand their operations.",https://www.retaildive.com/news/Amazon-big-bulky-fulfillment-center-for-oversized-items/648082/,False
Amazon unveils first fully autonomous mobile robot,"Published June 28, 2022","Dive Brief:Amazon last week unveiled its first fully autonomous mobile robot, named Proteus, which will lift and move package-carrying carts through its facilities.Proteus will first be deployed in outbound handling areas for GoCarts — non-automated, wheeled transports used to move packages — in fulfillment centers and sort centers,according to a company blog post. It autonomously moves in facilities and around employees via technology Amazon developed.""Our vision is to automate GoCart handling throughout the network, which will help reduce the need for people to manually move heavy objects through our facility and instead let them focus on more rewarding work,"" reads Amazon's blog post.Dive Insight:The presence of robots in Amazon's massive fulfillment network has grown rapidly since 2012, when the company acquired Kiva Systems and began using robotics in its facilities.Three years ago, Amazon already had more than 200,000 robotic drive units deployed. Today, it's more than 520,000, and the company counts more than a dozen types of robotic systems in its facilities.Amazon's continued push to invest in robotics comes as the company has suddenly found itselfoverstaffedat its facilities after years of rapid expansion to keep up with the e-commerce boom. It's also facedunion drivesandcontinued complaintsover itswarehouse safety record.Amazon's recordable incident rates were higher than average compared to warehouse peers, CEO Andy Jassy disclosed in his2021 Letter to Shareholders, citing U.S. public numbers.""At our scale (we hired over 300,000 people in 2021 alone, many of whom were new to this sort of work and needed training), it takes rigorous analysis, thoughtful problem-solving, and a willingness to invent to get to where you want,"" Jassy wrote.Amazon has touted the robots it deploys for their ability toease the physical burden on employees. Other companies from a variety of sectors are alsoinvesting more in roboticsto meet higher demand and to maximize employee productivity in a challenging labor environment.Beyond Proteus, Amazon detailed other recent robotics innovations in its blog post:Cardinal:A ""robotic workcell"" that selects, lifts and reads the label of a specific package out of a pile. It then places the selected package in a GoCart. This converts batch-based manual work into continuous, automated work. Amazon is testing a prototype to handle packages up to 50 pounds, and it expects to deploy it in fulfillment centers next year.Amazon Robotics Identification (AR ID):An AI-powered scanning capability that uses a camera system to remove the manual scanning process. Scanning at Amazon fulfillment centers is currently done manually.Containerized Storage System:A system that can find a container with a needed product, figure out how to move it to the employee and pick up the container once the employee has retrieved the product. This cuts down on the need for employees to reach, bend or climb to retrieve items.While Amazon has deployed a variety of robots throughout its supply chain, Proteus stands out for its ability to navigate unrestricted areas employees are present in.""Historically, it’s been difficult to safely incorporate robotics in the same physical space as people,"" reads Amazon's blog post. ""We believe Proteus will change that while remaining smart, safe, and collaborative.""",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-unveils-first-fully-autonomous-mobile-robot-proteus-warehouse/626218/,False
European Union pries open Amazon Prime for marketplace sellers,"Published Dec. 20, 2022","Dive Brief:The European Union on Tuesdayannounced new rulesrestricting Amazon’s use of its marketplace sellers’ data; enhancing their access to Amazon’s “buy box;” and easing sellers’ and shippers’ participation in Prime. They’re based on commitments the e-retailer offeredin Julythat were made stricter after market testing and public comment conducted through Sept. 9, the E.U. said.Amazon must comply within months,by June 2023, and after that faces fines of up to 10% of its annual revenue or a periodic penalty of 5% per day of its daily revenue for every day of non-compliance. An independent trustee will monitor implementation and compliance, according to an E.U. press release.“We are pleased that we have addressed the European Commission’s concerns and resolved these matters,” an Amazon spokesperson said by email. “While we continue to disagree with several of the preliminary conclusions the European Commission made, we have engaged constructively to ensure that we can continue to serve customers across Europe and support the 225,000 European small and medium sized businesses selling through our stores.”Dive Insight:These rules spring from concerns around Amazon’s position as the operator of a third-party marketplace that also competes with those sellers, asdescribed in remarksTuesday from Margrethe Vestager, the E.U.’s executive vice president and its commissioner for competition.The political body launched investigations into the e-commerce giant’s business practices starting in 2019, eventually concluding that it “abused its dominance on the French, German and Spanish markets for the provision of online marketplace services to third-party sellers” and “that Amazon's rules and criteria for the Buy Box and Prime unduly favour its own retail business, as well as marketplace sellers that use Amazon's logistics and delivery services.”The new rules crack open Prime’s formidable structure with four sets of changes, according to Vestager.First, Amazon will apply “non-discriminatory conditions and criteria for sellers to qualify for the Prime,” regardless of which carrier sellers use; second, marketplace sellers are free to use Amazon’s logistics or independent carriers for Prime deliveries and can negotiate directly with carriers for Prime deliveries; third, “no data generated by the activity of other carriers would flow to Amazon logistics;” and fourth, Amazon won’t keep carriers from contacting the end customer directly to track their parcels.“This means that by next summer, Amazon will have to end any preferential treatment towards its own retail and logistics operations in Europe,”Vestager said. “So today's decision sets the rules that Amazon will need to play by in the future instead of Amazon determining these rules for all players on its platform. With these new rules, competing independent retailers, carriers and European customers will have more opportunities and choice.”",https://www.retaildive.com/news/european-union-antitrust-amazon-prime-marketplace-sellers/639187/,True
"Amid Amazon’s Prime sale, workers stage walkout at key Illinois facility","Published Oct. 12, 2022","Dive Brief:About 30 workers at a Joliet, Illinois, Amazon warehouse known as MDW2 on Tuesday walked out, a collective action they are calling “Prime Walkout” according to Warehouse Workers for Justice, a labor advocacy and education center.The workers also posted a letter to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy saying they’re exercising their “right to engage in concerted activities for the purpose of mutual aid and protection” under national labor and occupational safety laws and demanding “a safer and healthier workplace and a living wage of $25 per hour.”An Amazon spokesperson, speaking by phone, downplayed the action, saying that just 10 workers joined a group gathered at the site during their lunch break. “We value employee feedback and are always listening,” Amazon said in an emailed statement, noting it isinvesting $1 billion in front-line employee wage hikesthis year.Dive Insight:The group’s action comes as Amazon holds itssecond major Prime salethis year, and the same week that workers at another Amazon warehouse in Albany, New York, begin to vote onwhether to unionize.Amazon’s speedy Prime fulfillment means that the pressure is always on at Amazon’s warehouses, not just during Prime Day, however, according to Marcos Ceniceros, executive director of Warehouse Workers for Justice. The MDW2 plant is one of 10 “cross-dock” facilities that help funnel merchandise to fulfillment centers to enable the Prime promise of at least two-day shipping, he said by phone.Ceniceros disputed Amazon’s characterization of the turnout. Some Joliet facility workers joined the walkout during their break or came from home because they didn’t have a shift, but even more, including some who he said were too intimidated to participate, are supportive. Warehouse Workers for Justice gathered some 700 signatures from the facility's workforce in support of the pay and workplace requests outlined Tuesday, he said.In addition to $25 per hour, the group wants Amazon to improve workplace issues involving safety and equitable employment. Sometimes seriously injured workers have been given inadequate medical attention, for example, and racist incidents aren’t properly addressed, which have been recorded in numerous complaints to managers and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Ceniceros said. In response to questions about workplace conditions in Joliet, Amazon said safety is its top priority and that racism is not tolerated in its workplaces. The company also said it has robust safety protocols and more than 8,000 safety professionals.“Amazon is not only downplaying the turnout, they’re ignoring our demands,”Cenicerossaid. “Amazon’s entire business model is on the backs of these warehouse workers. They’ll tout that they pay above minimum wage, but it’s not nearly a living wage.”In an email the company said its front-line employees in customer fulfillment and transportation on average earn $19, within a range of $16 to $26 per hour, depending on the job and what is paid locally for comparable work. A spokesperson declined to say how much workers at the Joliet site are paid.According to the living wage calculator from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, aliving wage for the Jolietarea would be over $19 per hour for a single adult without children, close to $36 per hour for a single adult with one child, or just over $25 per hour in households with two children if two adults are working.",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-prime-sale-warehouse-walkout/633881/,False
FTC investigates Amazon’s $1.7B bid to acquire iRobot,"Published Sept. 21, 2022","Dive Brief:Taking a closer look at a deal that would expand Amazon’s reach into consumers’ homes, the Federal Trade Commission hasrequested additional informationand documentation on Amazon’s planned acquisition of iRobot, according to a securities filing fromiRoboton Tuesday.The filing states that both Amazon and iRobot received a second request from the FTC for more information on Monday. This follows the standard notification and report forms both companies provided the FTC and Department of Justice on Aug. 19 for antitrust review.Amazon in early Augustannounced plansto acquire the company known for its automated vacuum, the Roomba, for around $1.7 billion. The deal would expand the retailer’s existing line of home devices, such as Amazon Ring and Blink.Dive Insight:Amazon is being investigated by the federal antitrust agency in more ways than one.The probe of its iRobot deal is in addition to an investigation by the FTC intoAmazon’s One Medical acquisition. A second request for both deals means Amazoncannot move forwardwith the acquisitions “until the companies have substantially complied with the additional investigatory request,” per the FTC.Amazon and iRobot declined to provide additional comment.On privacy concerns related to the acquisition of iRobot, Amazon previously told Retail Dive “we think we’ve been very good stewards of peoples’ data across all of our business.” However, the company recently came under fire when it admitted toproviding police with security camerainformation from its Ring systems 11 times without customer consent in 2022.Several of the Roomba vacuum models from iRobot utilize atracking methodthat allows the device to map out and remember obstacles, such as furniture, in a home to improve future cleaning cycles.",https://www.retaildive.com/news/ftc-investigates-amazons-irobot-acquisition/632311/,True
"Amazon layoffs will top 18K, many in retail","Published Jan. 5, 2023","Dive Brief:Following areview of its operations, Amazon is laying off more employees in its retail business, CEO Andy Jassy told employees Wednesday. Jassy said he posted the news publicly after it was leaked.In all, including layoffsconfirmed in November, Amazon will “eliminate just over 18,000 roles,”primarily in its Amazon Stores, and People, Experience and Technology divisions, according to Jassy’s blog post.“These changes will help us pursue our long-term opportunities with a stronger cost structure,” he said. Affected employees will receive separation payment, transitional health insurance benefits and external job placement support, he also said.Dive Insight:Amazon is uncharacteristically down-shifting. What is adding up to be a significant number of layoffs signals a correction to the company’s over-expansion as the pandemic helped fuel online sales growth. And it’s a sign that it may beentering a new eramore focused on profits.In the last five years the e-commerce giant added more than a million employees, with “a particularly frenzied expansion” during the pandemic, GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said in emailed comments.“All of this activity was predicated on the incorrect assumption that sales of Amazon’s products and services would continue to grow at a rapid clip,” he said. “With solid profits flowing, Amazon also became very bullish about expanding into new areas and was generous in staffing those divisions. However, it is now evident that the steep upward trajectory Amazon plotted over the pandemic years has come to an end.”In his blog post, Jassy defended the steep cuts, and sought to assure investors that the company’s knack for disruption would continue despite them.“These changes will help us pursue our long-term opportunities with a stronger cost structure; however, I’m also optimistic that we’ll be inventive, resourceful, and scrappy in this time when we’re not hiring expansively and eliminating some roles,” he said. “Companies that last a long time go through different phases.”The cuts are prudent, but there is a risk to tightening the ship, Saunders warned.“While the company has enough financial power to keep the lights on, a tighter environment means it will have to cut back investment on innovation,” he said. “Given that this has been the hallmark of Amazon’s success over the years, this is a worrying prospect.”Amazon isn’t the only retailer thatmisjudged the staying powerof the pandemic’s effects on demand. Nike and others bulked up on inventory, for example, which they have since scrambled to unload, BMO Capital Markets Managing Director Simeon Siegel noted last year. But Amazon, infamous for its data capabilities, should probably have known better, according to Saunders.“The shock of all of this is that Amazon, with its armies of smart people, did not see some of the pandemic shifts as temporary,” he said. “A lot of bad assumptions were made in determining recruitment policy over the past few years, and these have now come back to bite the company.”",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-retail-layoffs-top-eighteen-thousand/639702/,True
Amazon cited by OSHA for failing to keep warehouse workers safe,"Published Jan. 19, 2023","Dive Brief:A Department of Labor agency cited Amazon for failing to provide a safe workplace in its warehouse facilities, adding to the penalties the companyalready facesin an ongoing investigation, according toa news releaseWednesday.Investigators with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration found Amazon warehouse workers to be at high risk for lower back injuries and other musculoskeletal disorders. This is due to the frequency workers are required to lift packages and other items, long hours required to complete tasks and other issues, per the release.Amazon faces a total of $60,269 in proposed penalties tied to the violations. The company “strongly” disagrees with the allegations and intends to appeal, Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement.Dive Insight:The citations announced Wednesday add further fuel to complaints about Amazon's warehouse safety record and employee workload. OSHA already cited Amazon for recordkeeping violations on work-related injuries and illnessesin December.""Each of these inspections found work processes that were designed for speed but not safety, and they resulted in serious worker injuries,"" Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health Doug Parker said of the most recent citations in a statement. ""While Amazon has developed impressive systems to make sure its customers' orders are shipped efficiently and quickly, the company has failed to show the same level of commitment to protecting the safety and well-being of its workers.""One citation stemming from a New Windsor, New York, warehouse inspection said employees were exposed to ergonomic hazards during the package stowing process.""The high frequency of lifts and height of stow shelves placed employees at risk for low back and shoulder injuries,""said the citation, which was issued Tuesday.To reduce the injury risk during the stowing process, the citation said Amazon could eliminate totes stored at floor height and have machines take on some or all of the process, among other measures.OSHAs investigation also found that employees in a Waukegan, Illinois, facility arebeing struck and injured byheavy packages after losing control of them during the manual handling process. Injury examples include a foot fracture from a 55-pound package and a ""crushing/smashing"" face injury from 61 pounds of furniture. The agency did not issue a citation on the matter, instead recommending Amazon voluntarily take steps to address it.Nantel said the government's allegations don't reflect the reality of safety at Amazon sites, adding that the company will share more during the appeal process about advancements it has made to further reduce injuries.""Over the last several months we’ve demonstrated the extent to which we work every day to mitigate risk and protect our people, and our publicly available data show we’ve reduced injury rates nearly 15% between 2019 and 2021,"" Nantel said. ""What’s more, the vast majority of our employees tell us they feel our workplace is safe.""The citations stem from OSHA's continued investigation into six Amazon warehouses in five states, which began this past summer. The agency isn't finished digging into Amazon's operations yet — the alleged violations announced Wednesday are tied to inspections at three facilities in Florida, Illinois and New York.

Amazon doubles down on generic drugs with new RxPass subscription,"Published Jan. 25, 2023","Dive Brief:Amazon is launching a generic drug discount program for Prime members, beefing up its pharmacy offering as the ecommerce giant continues its push into healthcare.The subscription service, called RxPass, is $5 per month for customers with Prime to fill as many prescriptions as needed from a list of about 50 generic medications, including delivery to their doorstep.RxPass does not accept insurance, including Medicare and Medicaid coverage. It is available in 42 states.Dive Insight:Amazon already sells a number of generic drugs through Amazon Pharmacy. Though costs vary, medications can sell for as low as $1 for a month’s supply. Given that, the extent of RxPass’ role as an inexpensive generic drug pathway is unclear. In a release,Amazon said Prime memberswho take two or more medications a month could save “significant time and money” with the RxPass subscription.Annually, RxPass would run consumers $60 on top of the cost of a Prime membership, which is $139 a year in the U.S. However, VP of Amazon Pharmacy John Love told Reutersthe average Prime member should save $100 a yearwith RxPass.Covered medications address more than 80 chronic conditions,and include drugs likethe antibiotic amoxicillin, anti-inflammatory drug naproxen, estrogen steroid hormone estradiol and sildenafil, which is used to treat erectile dysfunction and sold under the brand name Viagra.In recent years, both healthcare stakeholders and those outside the industry have launched initiatives to manufacture and sell generics to patients.Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team and host of TV show Shark Tank, formed the Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company roughly a year ago. The online pharmacy cuts out drug middleman and sells the medication at cost, plus a 15% markup and pharmacist fee.In addition, a number of health systems banded together in 2018 to form nonprofit drug company CivicaRx, which began supplying member hospitals with genericsone year afterits launch. A subsidiary, called CivicaScript, haspartnered with payers like Elevanceto develop and manufacture common but pricey generics that don’t have enough market competition to drive down cost, andlaunched its first product in August.Amazon’s healthcare portfolio has grown to include telehealth, wearable devices, clinical research, nutrition and more. The retail company launched Amazon Pharmacyfollowing its PillPack acquisition in 2018in an effort to compete with drugstores like CVS and Walgreens amid the rising need for affordable medications.One in four Americans struggle to afford prescription drugs, and more than a fourth forgo their medications at some point due to cost, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll.Amazon’s efforts to elbow into healthcare haven’t always been successful. Thecompany shut downits hybrid care offering for employers, called Amazon Care, at the end of 2022, after flagging client demand. Another high-profile effort to lower healthcare costs, called Haven,flamed out in 2021after a few years.Another key prong of Amazon’s plans in healthcare include its$3.9 billion acquisition of primary care company One Medicalannounced last summer.

Amazon announces first peak season fee for its fulfillment services,"Published Aug. 17, 2022","Dive Brief:Amazon announced a peak season fee on its fulfillment services for third-party sellers from Oct. 15 to Jan. 14, the first time the company has instituted such a surcharge.The holiday peak fulfillment fee will cost an average of $0.35 per item sold through Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) in the U.S. and Canada, the company wrotein its announcement to sellers. Amazon said the fee will cover increased fulfillment and logistics costs that coincide with the holiday shipping spike.""We have previously absorbed these cost increases, but seasonal expenses are reaching new heights,"" Amazon said. ""As a result, we decided that similar to other carriers, we will implement a holiday peak fulfillment fee that applies during a timebound period each year.""Fulfillment by Amazon fees increase for peak seasonSize tierShipping weightBefore Oct. 15Oct. 15, 2022 - Jan. 14, 2023Small standard6 oz or less$3.07$3.28Small standard12-16 oz$3.77$3.98Large standard2-3 lbs$6.08$6.60Large standard3-20 lbs$6.44 + $0.32/lb above the first 3 lbs$6.96 + $0.32/lb above first 3 lbsSOURCE:Amazon. Fees include a fuel and inflation surcharge.Dive Insight:For businesses selling on Amazon, using the company's fulfillment services instead of other carriers will no longer shield them from added peak season shipping costs. As Amazon noted in its announcement, the fee is similar to the surcharges or price hikes major delivery providers — such asFedExand theU.S. Postal Service— implement during the holidays. UPS is expected to announce its peak season surcharges soon.The new fee is another example of Amazon passing on theelevated operating costsit has seen this year to independent sellers leaning on FBA. The company implemented a5% fuel and inflation surchargefor FBA in April after already hiking fees in January. The fuel and inflation surcharge applies to both peak and non-peak fulfillment fees,according to Amazon.Desert Cactus, an e-commerce consumer products company that sells licensed products on Amazon, will likely see $100,000 in added costs due to the new fee, President and founder Joe Stefani said in an interview. The company has passed on a portion of previous fulfillment cost increases to customers, but it doesn't plan to raise prices higher in response to the peak season fee, at least in the immediate future.""It's too big of a pain in the butt because we have over 30,000 SKUs to do like a slight modification, because they don't make it easy to do so,"" Stefani said. ""So if we were going to raise prices, it would take a while. I think we'd rather just kind of hold the line if we possibly could.""Amazon told sellers that despite the added peak season charge, its fulfillment fees will remain 70% less expensive on average than comparable two-day shipping alternatives. Stefani said Amazon remains the least expensive option for his company to use.It is surprising Amazon didn't implement a peak fulfillment fee sooner, Joshua Rawe, co-founder of eSpark,wrote on LinkedIn. The company provides services for brands' Amazon marketplace channels.""Amazon has barely raised fulfillment fees relative to the increases in shipping costs,"" Rawe wrote. ""They assuredly absorbed a lot of those price hikes. Of course I'd rather fees go down, but this change is to be expected. My takeaway is to increase margins wherever possible whether it's negotiating with suppliers or offering a superior product.""",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-announces-first-peak-season-fee-fulfillment-services-fba-holiday-surcharge/629905/,True

These citations include ""failing to record injuries and illnesses, misclassifying injuries and illnesses, not recording injuries and illnesses within the required time, and not providing OSHA with timely injury and illness records,"" per the release. Amazon faces $29,008 in proposed penalties as a result.“Solving health and safety problems in the workplace requires injury and illness records to be accurate and transparent,” said Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health Doug Parker, in a statement. “Our concern is that nothing will be done to keep an injury from recurring if it isn’t even recorded in the logbook which – in a company the size of Amazon – could have significant consequences for a large number of workers.”Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement that the company acknowledges “a small number of administrative errors” may have been made through the years but it’s confident in numbers it’s reported to the government.“We are reviewing OSHA’s allegations and are pleased that OSHA acknowledged that all of the alleged violations are ‘other than serious’ and involve minor infractions,” Nantel said, adding that employee safety is Amazon’s top priority.OSHA continues to investigate six Amazon warehouse facilities in five states. The agency opened inspections on July 18 at warehouses in Florida, Illinois and New York. On Aug. 1, it opened inspections at locations in Colorado, Idaho and New York.OSHA issued the recordkeeping citations to comply with a six-month time limit under federal law.

CEO Andy Jassy noted in his2021 Letter to Shareholdersthat the company's recordable incident rates were higher than average versus its warehouse peers.""When I first started in my new role, I spent significant time in our fulfillment centers and with our safety team, and hoped there might be a silver bullet that could change the numbers quickly.

The approach contributed to the $6 billion in added Q1 costs, as a slowdown in online shopping activity left the company with excess capacity.""For the consumer business, as I said earlier, we currently have some excess capacity in the network that we need to grow into,"" Olsavsky said. ""So, we've brought down our build expectations. Note again that many of the build decisions were made 18 to 24 months ago, so there are limitations on what we can adjust midyear.""Amazon typically pushes to get its fulfillment centers running as soon as possible, as a wider warehouse footprint helps the company cut down on shipping costs, Wulfraat said. However, several of the company's larger facilities expected to open in the second half of 2022 will be delayed by at least a year to avoid adding further labor expenses, he added. Lower productivity from overstaffing in the company's fulfillment network made up about one-third of Amazon's added Q1 costs.""It will take some time to iron out the wrinkles but they will get through it,"" Wulfraat said.Amazon did not respond to requests for comment from sister publication Supply Chain Dive on the reported warehouse delays and cancellations. The delay of the company's Davenport, Iowa, facility to early 2024 was due to supply chain challenges, according to a statement from the Quad Cities Chamber, which is based in the city.“It is common for developments of this size to have situations that impact their timeline along the way,"" according to the statement.

Amazon opens robotic fulfillment center in Connecticut,"Published May 8, 2023","Amazon opened a robotics fulfillment center in Windsor, Connecticut, where workers will process orders alongside bots.The 3.8 million square-foot facility will have “thousands of robotic systems such as mobile robots and robotic handling systems that help employees deliver for customers everyday,” an Amazon spokesperson told sister publication Supply Chain Dive.More than 2,000 employees will work at the facility, which primarily handles smaller shipments such as books, electronics and toys.

Amazon Air's Newark hub fallout adds to its 2022 logistics stressors,"Published July 14, 2022","After years of relentless expansion, Amazon’s fulfillment network has encountered a series of stumbling blocks in 2022. Overstaffed warehouses. Higher transportation costs.A glut of capacity.Turbulence has now hit the e-commerce giant’s facility buildout for Amazon Air, which focuses on moving inventory by airplane among its parent company’s sprawling network of warehouses. Plans for an Amazon Air hub at the Newark Liberty International Airport have dissipated, the Port Authority of New York and New Jerseyannounced last week.The authority entered into negotiations with Amazonin August 2021for a 20-year lease to redevelop and expand air cargo facilities at the Newark, New Jersey, airport. The project would have created an Amazon-run air cargo campus and more than 1,000 jobs, but it came under fire fromelected officials and local activistsover issues such as workplace safety and environmental impact.“Unfortunately, the Port Authority and Amazon have been unable to reach an agreement on final lease terms and mutually concluded that further negotiations will not resolve the outstanding issues,” said Huntley Lawrence, COO of the port authority, in a statement. “The growth of air cargo and the redevelopment of airport facilities in a manner that benefits the region as well as the local community remain a top priority of the Port Authority.”Despite the outcome, Amazon looks forward to continued investment in New Jersey, spokesperson Maria Boschetti said in an emailed statement. The situation exemplifies the crossroads Amazon finds itself at: The company needs to invest to accelerate fulfillment times, while also trimming the fat from its pandemic buildout.Why Amazon sought to build a hub in NewarkIn terms of facilities, Amazon has pivoted its Air network facility buildout in recent years from hubs well outside large cities to airports in densely populated areas, Joseph Schwieterman, director of the Chaddick Institute for Metropolitan Development at DePaul University, said in an interview.“[Newark is] almost ideally located because it’s near container yards, it’s so close to downtown New York, it actually is surrounded by areas that are zoned for industrial,” Schwieterman said. “There’s a lot of potential there for Amazon.”While the Newark hub plan has been shelved, Amazon can continue to lean on the multiple gateways it has in the New York area, including John F. Kennedy International Airport. But none of those have the upside of an air cargo facility at Newark, Schwieterman added.The lack of a Newark hub limits the company’s ability to move inventory to major northeast markets faster — making the ramp-up of its one-day delivery service for Prime members a trickier endeavor. It also hinders Amazon’s push to build the transportation infrastructure necessary to directly compete with UPS and FedEx, Dean Maciuba, managing partner USA at Crossroads Parcel Consulting,wrote on LinkedIn.“The proposed regional hub at Newark’s Liberty airport was key to Amazon’s ability to efficiently serve the metro NYC/NJ markets with domestic express overnight delivery services,” Maciuba said.But some Newark community members wanted the company to steer clear of the airport. Chloe Desir, environmental justice organizer at the Newark-based Ironbound Community Corporation,said in a statementthat Amazon is unwilling “to comply with basic standards of safe, well paying jobs without added pollution or injury rates set by the community.” A state senator, Joe Cryan, said he was “thankful to the Port Authority of NY/NJ for siding with the workers.”It’s not the first time Amazon has seen resistance for an Air-related project.Amazon Air’s planned expansion in Lakeland, Florida, has been met withpushbackfromnoise pollution-wary residentsafter the local airport experienced a surge in cargo activity. Lakeland Linder International, at which Amazon established an air cargo complexin July 2020, saw landed cargo weight grow 263% from 2020 to 2021, according to preliminaryFederal Aviation Administration data.Amazon Air’s San Bernardino, California, airport expansion has also encountered legal resistance from state Attorney General Rob Bonta, who cited pollution concernsin his requestin January for the Ninth Circuit to review its ruling that allowed the project to move forward.“The brand is golden, yet the dominance and arrogance of the online retail giant continues to drive challenges from special interest groups across America,” Maciuba wrote of Amazon.Despite setback, Amazon Air slated to continue its expansionThe cancellation of the Newark cargo hub negotiations adds to a rocky 2022 for Amazon’s fulfillment network. The company has delayed or canceled plans for at least 13 warehouses as it grapples with excess fulfillment and transportation capacity, which contributed to$6 billion in added Q1 costs.Smarter inventory positioning will be critical for Amazon to minimize fulfillment costs as it expands one-day delivery offerings for Prime members. That would allow Amazon to reduce the amount of freight it’s forced to fly, a transport mode which comes with a higher price tag, Jason Murray, Shipium co-founder and CEO and a former vice president of supply chain and retail services at Amazon, said in an interview earlier this year.“Where costs go up is when you’re wrong [on inventory placement] and you have to fly stuff — that’s what drives your costs up,” said Murray. “If you get it right 80% of the time, it’s going to cost you this certain amount. And if you get it right 81% of the time, it’s going to significantly reduce your cost structure.”It’s one reason Amazon Air is set to keep playing a prominent role in its parent company’s supply chain.Amazon's flight activity more than doubled in less than two yearsAmazon Air's average daily flights based on five representative, or non-holiday, days of activity.When Amazon is caught flat-footed by an order for an item not sitting in a nearby warehouse, Amazon Air can bring the goods in quickly without needing to use an outside air cargo carrier, another added expense. That reduces the financial sting in instances when the company “misses” on inventory placement, said Murray.Amazon Air’s network has steadily grown to fulfill this critical need. The subsidiary expanded its fleet from 73 planes in late August 2021 to 88 planes in mid-March, according to aMarch brieffrom the Chaddick Institute. It also increased its flight activity and grew its airport network to be within 100 miles of 73% of the U.S. population.And going forward, Amazon may lean more on its air cargo operations to keep its international supply chain running smoothly in a time of frequent ocean congestion, according to the Chaddick Institute’s report.“We believe the airline will move slowly into transoceanic flying over the next two years, likely with a dozen or fewer planes, but the longer term could bring a much more robust expansion,” the report said.Additionally, there are U.S. regions still ripe for Amazon Air service expansion as the company looks to fulfill customers’ speedy delivery expectations countrywide — introducing new projects and potential opposition in more cities.“There’s still some big holes in the network, particularly in the mountain states and northern Great Plains where the population is thin,” Schwieterman said.",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-air-newark-hub-fallout-logistics-fulfillment-stressors/627263/,True
Amazon joins India’s experimental open-source e-commerce network,"Published Feb. 24, 2023","Dive Brief:Amazon hasdecided to integrateits logistics network and AWS-powered small-business services in India with the Open Network for Digital Commerce, the e-commerce giant said in a press release Friday.Thenonprofit ONDC“is an initiative aiming at promoting open networks for all aspects of exchange of goods and services over digital or electronic networks,” to the benefit of small merchants and consumers, according to a press release last yearfrom the Indian government.The U.S. remains Amazon’s largest market, generating some 69% of revenue, and the rest of the world, including India, is its second largest, with about 14%, according to research from Roth MKM analysts. Last year, year-over-year revenue growth in the secondary market declined to 10%, from 38% in 2021, they said.Dive Insight:With Amazon’s disruption of U.S. retailarguably ebbing, emerging e-commerce markets like India’s may be especially enticing. It may seem surprising thatAmazon would join an effortthat aims to even the playing field in India’s still developing e-commerce landscape, presumably to the detriment of giants like Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart, but the area is increasingly important to Amazon’s long-term growth.Speaking to analysts earlier this month, CEO Andy Jassy said that inflation and the war in Ukraine are complicating its prospects in Europe. By contrast, less established markets, while they require “a certain amount of fixed investment” of finances and time, are on a trajectory that resembles the company’s previous growth in North America, he said.“If you look at countries like India and Brazil and the Middle East and Africa and Turkey, Mexico and Australia and a number of those types of countries, we like what we're seeing,” he said. “We think it's the right investment and believe we're going to have a large profitable international e-commerce business.”In a statement,ManishTiwary, country manager for the India consumer business at Amazon India, said the company’s goals are “closely aligned withONDC’sobjectives of digitally enabling small businesses, and providing convenience and choice to customers across the country.”“We are excited about the opportunities to mobilise Amazon’s industry-leading infrastructure and technology, including logistics, and small business digitization tools, to help the ONDC accelerate its objectives,”Tiwary also said. “We remain committed to be being a catalyst for India’s digitization efforts throughout the economy.”T. Koshy,ONDC’sCEO, hailed Amazon “taking its first step in coming in as the logistics partner in theONDCnetwork, which is a globally pioneering idea established with a view todemocratisedigital commerce in India.”“We also hope that the buyer and seller platforms areonboardedas early as possible,” Koshy added.",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-joins-indias-experimental-open-source-e-commerce-network/643513/,True
Amazon drone delivery to take off in California,"Published June 15, 2022","Dive Brief:Amazon will soon offer some of its first U.S. Prime Air drone deliveries to customers inLockeford, California, the company announcedin a blog postMonday. Deliveries will commence in the San Joaquin County community later this year.Prime Air will deliver packages weighing up to five pounds in less than an hour via drones, according to Amazon spokesperson AvZammit. Once an order is placed, Amazon’s new MK27-2 drone will fly to the location, descend to the customer's backyard and hover at a “safe” height before releasing the package.Amazon said it is working with the Federal Aviation Administration and local officials to obtain the necessary permissions to conduct deliveries inLockeford. The FAA will review the plans to confirm operations abide by theNational Environmental Policy Act, a regular procedure for advanced drone operations.Dive Insight:Eligible customers in Lockeford will be able to order thousands of products through the service, which Amazon claims is ""the largest selection of items to ever be available for drone delivery."" But building a safe and cost-effective drone to deliver packages has been a challenging pursuit for Amazon to scale since founder Jeff Bezos unveiled the plans in 2013.""It’s relatively easy to use existing technology to fly a light payload a short distance that’s within your line of sight, but it’s a very different challenge to build a network that can deliver to customers across large communities,"" according to Amazon's blog post.Amazon’s U.S. Prime Air service could succeed in the difficult space as the company can cover for drones’ current shortcomings,said John McClymont, director of operations strategy and continuous process improvement at Brink’s,in a LinkedIn post Monday. Sub-five pound packages make up a large percentage of Amazon’s volume, and the company can leverage its warehouse footprint to make the most of drones’ short delivery radius, according to McClymont.There are also benefits to Amazon delivering to a smaller community like Lockeford — roughly 40 miles south of Sacramento — via drone. Yard space is readily available, providing a spacious drop off point for packages. The efficiency of traditional van delivery, currently challenged by steep gas prices and a competitive labor market, is also limited in communities with low population density.Regulatory clearance will be critical for Amazon's drone delivery ambitions as it ramps up its operations in Lockeford and, eventually, to other areas of the country.Amazon sent a request to the FAA in November to remove certain regulatory conditions for its drone operations.According to a letterfrom Prime Air's Director of Safety, Flight Operations and Regulatory Affairs Sean Cassidy, Amazon's amendment requests include:Eliminating the ground station observer, aircraft observer and backyard safety office positions due to new drone features making them redundant or unnecessaryRemoving the 100-foot designated perimeter requirement from takeoff, landing and delivery pointsRemoving the minimum cruise altitude of 180 feet above ground levelThe proposed amendments would reflect the improved capabilities of Amazon's MK27-2 drone model, according to the letter.The MK27-2 has a hexagonal design allowing for six degrees of freedom for stability, along with propellers designed to minimize high-frequency soundwaves, according to Zammit. Amazon has also developed a sense-and-avoid system for its drones, allowing them to detect and avoid hazards without a visual observer monitoring the flight path, Zammit added.An FAA spokesperson said the agency doesn't comment on pending certification projects or discussions with companies.Other large companies are making their own advancements in the drone delivery space, including Walmart, UPS and Alphabet subsidiary Wing.

Amazon hits major setback in bid to overturn Staten Island union vote,"Published Sept. 2, 2022","A government official has recommended rejecting an objection by Amazon to the successful union vote at one if its fulfillment centers in New York’s Staten Island.The hearing officer with the National Labor Relations Board handling Amazon’s objection concluded that the board should overrule the objection and certify the union.After a hearing carried out over 24 days, the official concluded that Amazon had not proven that the regional NLRB office, the petitioner or third parties engaged in “objectionable conduct affecting the results of the election,” according to an NLRB spokesperson.Parties have until Sept. 16 to file objections before the presiding regional director considers the hearing officer’s recommendations. Any resulting objection can be appealed to the board.After a vote to form a union at the fulfillment center (known as JFK8) won by a nearly 11% margin, Amazon filed theobjection weeks later, accusing Regional Director Kathy Drew King and other Brooklyn staff of making statements “that call into question the Region’s ‘neutral’ stance” around the election and potentially disenfranchising some workers voting on the union, among other complaints.In a statement following the recommendation to reject its objection, an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement that the company was still reviewing the decision.“[W]e strongly disagree with the conclusion and intend to appeal,” the Amazon spokesperson said. “As we showed throughout the hearing with dozens of witnesses and hundreds of pages of documents, both the NLRB and the ALU improperly influenced the outcome of the election and we don’t believe it represents what the majority of our team wants.”The labor organizers, Amazon Labor Union, said ina statementafter receiving the hearing officer’s opinion, “While we are pleased with her findings, the Amazon workers in the ALU understand that this is just the beginning of a much longer fight.”",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-setback-bid-overturn-staten-island-union-vote/631129/,False
Amazon expands freeze in corporate hiring until next year,"Published Nov. 4, 2022","Dive Brief:Amazon ispausing hiringin its corporate workforce “for the next few months” in light of an uncertain economy, according to a company blog post from Beth Galetti, Amazon’s senior vice president of people experience and technology.The e-commerce giant last month said it would freeze corporate hiringin its retail operations, and the decision to pause on new incremental hires more widely came from CEO Andy Jassy and senior leadership, per Galetti’s post.The company will replace some employees who leave and hire new ones in some areas, Galetti said. “We still intend to hire a meaningful number of people in 2023, and remain excited about our significant investments in our larger businesses ” and new initiatives, she said.Dive Insight:These may be temporary halts to hiring at Amazon, and they reflect what Galetti described as “an unusual macro-economic environment.”“This is not the first time that we’ve faced uncertain and challenging economies in our past,” she said. “While we have had several years where we’ve expanded our headcount broadly, there have also been several years where we’ve tightened our belt and were more streamlined in how many people we added.”But these announcements also illustrate how much Amazon itself has gone from being a fast-growing disruptor to a more cautious corporation, according to GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders. Founder and former CEO Jeff Bezosonce famously boastedthat he “made billions of dollars of failures” at Amazon because taking big chances led to green shoots and ultimately major successes.“It used to be the case that not a week would go by without Amazon announcing some kind of new initiative or plan for growth,” Saunders said in emailed comments. “However, over the course of this year that expansionary outlook has disappeared and has given rise to a more contractionary mindset.”The company last week warned that itmight notch zero profitsin Q4. Late in the third quarter sales slowed, and the company’s attempt at a second Prime sale in October, while it raked in billions,was nevertheless disappointing. In Q3 operating income declined 48% to $2.5 billion and net income fell 9% to $2.9 billion, with the North America segment swinging to a $412 million loss.Amazon’s effort to rein in costs is unsurprising given these struggles with profitability, and prudent given the economy, but the company needs to be careful about its pivot, according to Saunders.“While we do not see Amazon’s move as being detrimental – especially since it is already well staffed with plenty of talent – it will need to take a view on how much further it wants to cut and hold,” he said. “[The] necessity is to balance Amazon’s traditional experimental approach and tolerance of some failure with the need to deliver good returns. This will be a challenging equation for the retail giant to get right.”",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-expands-freeze-corporate-hiring-until-2023/635738/,False
Amazon Business debuts first major campaign in grab at office supplies category,"Published July 20, 2022","Dive Brief:Amazon Business, the e-commerce giant’s business-to-business subsidiary, on Monday released its first integrated broad-scale campaign, “Buy smarter. Dream bigger.,” per details shared with Retail Dive’s sister publication Marketing Dive.Made with agency Butler, Shine, Stern & Partners, the campaign features a 30-second national spot titled “PetTech” that depicts the imaginary launch of a pet-device company and demonstrates how Amazon’s platform can consolidate ordering, track spending and monitor other needs in one place.Other elements include national radio, digital and out-of-home (OOH) elements and a social media component in collaboration with Walker Sands. The effort targets businesses of any size that are buying supplies from multiple vendors.Dive Insight:Amazon is putting some additional marketing muscle behind its B2B arm as it looks to attract more companies to the platform and tout a positioning as a one-stop destination. The messaging emphasizes a seamless and streamlined experience, which could appeal to companies dealing with a hectic supply chain. It’s also a bid by Amazon to capture more share of the office supplies category, which hashad a rough few years due to the pandemic.Amazon Business is intended for businesses of any scale to consolidate their supply purchases, like pencils or face masks, under one roof by utilizing the e-commerce behemoth’s plethora of sellers and Amazon Prime perks, known as Business Prime. While Amazon is appealing to a broad base of potential customers, upstarts and small businesses are clearly a key target, as shown in “PetTech.”In the debut spot, a quick-witted Alpaca and Ostrich aid a room full of people who just invented a device that translates animal speech while they scramble to purchase all the necessary supplies to get their company off the ground. The solution, of course, is Amazon Business. The humorous take is meant to shy away from typical B2B advertising tropes and may help the platform gain traction, as 91% of global consumersreport that they prefer brands to be funny.To further market the product, Amazon Business is running OOH placements in key cities including Los Angeles, New York City and Chicago. It’s also placed advertisements in airports in the hopes of reaching business travelers. The strategy shows how B2B marketers are integrating more business-to-consumer tactics into their playbooks.Launched in 2015, Amazon Business today serves over 5 million businesses, including 80 Fortune 100 companies. It generated $25 billion in worldwide annualized sales last year, according to details shared with Marketing Dive. Amazon Business is also hosting its first in-person event, Reshape, to help market its products on Sept. 28-29 in Scottsdale, Arizona. The gathering will focus on the new ad campaign and creation of a “Smart Business Buying” category. Two additional spots for the campaign are in the works with no mentioned release date.Amazon Business isn’t the only one putting more resources behind its enterprise-oriented bets.

Amazon Fresh raises its threshold for free delivery to $150,"Published Jan. 30, 2023","Dive Brief:Amazon Fresh is significantly raising the threshold its Prime customers will need to meet in order to receive free grocery delivery, according to an email sent to members of its Prime service.Beginning Feb. 28, orders under $50 will incur a $9.95 fee; orders between $50 and $100 will incur a $6.95 fee; and orders between $100 and $150 will include a $3.95 fee. Only orders above $150 will not come with a fee.This change, which follows the company’s decision in 2021 to raise fees for Whole Foods Market orders, comes as Amazon tries to improve online grocery profitability and contends with the recent slowdown in e-commerce growth.Dive Insight:With this update, which applies to orders from both Amazon Fresh stores as well as its online-only service, Amazon is more than quadrupling the amount Prime shoppers must spend on a grocery order in order to get free delivery. Previously, the company waived delivery fees on orders over $35.The move echoes past steps Amazon has taken to address profitability across its budding grocery properties. In late 2021, Whole Foods caused a stir when it tacked on a$9.95 service feefor delivery orders after previously offering the service for free on orders over $35. Earlier that year, Amazonshutteredits Amazon Pantry stock-up grocery service.Moreover, the news highlights the harsh economic realities of offering online grocery service as costs mount and sales growth slows amid ongoing inflation.“We’re introducing a service fee on some Amazon Fresh delivery orders to help keep prices low in our online and physical grocery stores as we better cover grocery delivery costs and continue to enable offering a consistent, fast, and high-quality delivery experience,” an Amazon spokesperson said in an email. “We will continue to offer convenient two-hour delivery windows for all orders, and customers in some areas will be able to select a longer delivery window for a reduced fee.”Amazon Fresh will continue to offer free one-hour pickup service for Prime members, according to thebrand’s website, which also lists the new delivery fee structure.Amazon Fresh has been delivering groceries since 2007, and nowadays also incorporates a fleet of more than 40 stores.

Deflated expectations for Amazon in the post-Jeff Bezos era,"Published Oct. 24, 2022","This may be what “day two” at Amazonlooks like.Several analysts on Monday lowered their sales, profit and other targets ahead of the e-commerce giant’s third quarter earnings report Thursday, citing its rising expenses, disappointing Prime Day sales events and a tough macro environment marked by inflation.The company joins them in taking a more conservative approach to its own guidance, according to a Monday research note fromMKMPartners Managing DirectorRohitKulkarni. That could be part of a wider shift inretail strategy under CEO Andy Jassy, who took over from founder JeffBezoslast year, according toShlomoChopp, managing partner at real estate advisory firm Case Property Services.“I think Jeff Bezos is more of a founder or visionary, and Andy Jassy is more of a operations guy, and there's a difference between the two,” Chopp said by phone.Telsey Advisory Group on Monday lowered its expectations for Amazon sales and profits in both the third and fourth quarters, citing “softer macro trends in the US and international markets, the tighter consumer spending environment, and the lower-than-anticipated response to Prime Day 2022.”Those analysts, led by Joseph Feldman, expect that Amazon’s Q3 sales will benefit from the first Prime Day sales, which was held in July, but less than the 400 basis points of growth they previously anticipated. Research showed that, defending against inflation, many Prime Day shoppersstuck to buying essentials. The average order size during the second Prime sales event held earlier this month wasdown 23%from the July event, according to Numerator.“Our sense is the Prime Early Access Sale ... was lackluster as well,” Feldman said.With discretionary spending down as consumers spend more due to inflation and prioritize services like entertainment and dining out, Amazon is exposed, according to Wells Fargo analysts led by Brian Fitzgerald, citing declines in electronics sales and weakness in apparel and accessories.The company is leaning more heavily on non-retail operations to make money. MKM analysts said their communications with Amazon marketplace sellers lead them to believe that the Prime sales in October were below those in July, but that “ad spend on Amazon has stayed above industrytrendline.” The firm is lowering its e-commerce and Amazon marketplace assumptions while keeping its AWS, subscriptions and advertising estimates unchanged.This is another shift from the Bezos era, when the customerwas an obsession, according to Chopp.“For Jeff Bezos, his whole thing was ‘customer first,’” he said. “If you're advertising, you’re not giving people exactly what they're looking for, but trying to push them somewhere else. If you’re giving people only what they're looking for, what's the point of advertising?”Amazon is also facing exploding costs. Those stem from hiring and wage increases, including150,000 announced ahead of the holidays,which could add $1 billion to its costs next year; higher stock-based compensation that likely adds as much as $4 billion this year in incremental deleverage in 2022; and potential costs from its fights against unions, according to MKM Partners.Despite the new pressures and possibly the new approach, Amazon remains in a good position longer term, analysts said.“Amazon’s profitability is likely to be pressured from elevated promotions across retail, inflated operating costs, including labor, supply chain, and last-mile delivery, and ongoing strategic investments,” Telsey’s Feldman said. “Beyond these trends, we still expect Amazon to outperform the broader retail environment, given ongoing market share gains from leveraging its sticky customer base and small business relationships.”",https://www.retaildive.com/news/Amazon-forecast-lowered-Q3/634784/,True
Amazon rolls out delivery route algorithm to reduce miles driven,"Published Sept. 1, 2022","Dive Brief:Amazon expects its new delivery route algorithm will help it avoid millions of miles driven this year after deploying it across the entire U.S.,according to a poston the Amazon Science website last week.The Customer Order and Network Density Optimizer (Condor) algorithm assesses customer orders before they leave a fulfillment center to identify the most effective shipping options. It began running in a few Amazon delivery stations in January before going live nationwide. Now, the company plans to deploy it in other countries in the next few months, per the post.“We can enable carriers to deliver more packages to more customers on time, while reducing miles driven and carbon emissions from fuel,” said Andrea Qualizza, a senior principal scientist at Amazon, in the post.Dive Insight:For Amazon, a decision on how a customer order should be fulfilled is made quickly based on item location and other factors. However, there can be a five- to six-hour gap from when an order is placed to when the fulfillment center begins processing the order, and the plan may be updated if a nearby customer places an order later in the day.This period prior to fulfillment gives Condor a chance to reevaluate the original decision multiple times to see if a more optimal route can be created.Condor takes into account the entire geographic area a delivery station serves while determining how orders are split into shipments and the sourcing fulfillment center for each shipment. The program's ""breakthrough"" is that it is able to reduce the number of possible routing decisions to less than 10 per geographical block, despite the complexity involved.Condor proved its mettle during tests involving Amazon scientists and engineers. In one experiment, a few selected cities were split between a group using the new program and a group not using it. It determined that Condor reduced required routing resources by about 0.5%.“That means that if the whole network needs 50,000 routes without CONDOR, with CONDOR we should need just 49,750 routes,” Amazon Principal Scientist Rohit Malshe said in the post.Delivering the same number of packages in fewer routes and miles driven helps parcel carriers save on last-mile shipping costs, a big reason why UPS and FedEx have launched their own initiatives in this regard.UPS' pilotinvolves holding an order for as long as the service agreement allows until it can match another shipment to the same address. FedEx is consolidating routes run by its separate Express and Ground companies via its""Network 2.0"" plan.",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-deploys-new-delivery-route-algorithm-condor/631020/,False
"Amazon closes, cancels more warehouses as cost-cutting persists","Published March 1, 2023","Dive Brief:Amazon’s fulfillment network cuts have bled into 2023 as the e-commerce giant continues to slash operating expenses, according to data from a consulting firm tracking the company's logistics footprint.Amazon has canceled, closed or delayed 99 U.S. facilities, impacting nearly 32.3 million square feet of active or planned ground-level space in 30 states, MarcWulfraat,president and founder ofMWPVLInternational,said in a Friday email.

Those efforts are slated to continue this year.In aFeb. 2 earnings call, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said reducing the cost to serve customers within the company's operations is a top priority. Amazon's aggressive efforts to expand its fulfillment center and transportation network have created areas within it where the company is working to become more efficient and productive.""To figure out how to be really efficient across all those links and have them be highly utilized and to get the flows in those facilities working the right way, it takes time,"" Jassy said. ""So we're working very hard on it. I'm pleased with the progress we made in Q4, and you can see that in some of the results. But that work will extend into '23.""Fulfillment centers, which pick, pack and ship orders, and delivery stations, which prep orders for final-mile delivery, are the facility types that have been most affected by the cost-cutting measures. Twenty-one facilities in five countries outside the U.S. have also been closed, canceled or delayed, according to MWPVL.“Of course, as we’ve always done, we evaluate our network to make sure it fits our business needs and to improve the experience for our employees, customers, partners, and drivers,” Kelly said. “We may close or delay facilities, enhance existing facilities, or open new facilities, and we weigh a variety of factors when deciding where to develop future sites or maintain a presence.”Despite the purported closures and cancellations, Amazon still has plans to open 231 facilities totaling more than 82 million square feet,per MWPVL data.

Amazon to slow fulfillment spend as it prioritizes regional model,"Published May 1, 2023","Dive Brief:Amazon expects to slow capital investments in 2023 as the e-commerce giant focuses its efforts on lowering the costs of operating its sprawling fulfillment network.Executives said inan earnings call Thursdaythat capital expenditures this year will be less than the $59 billion spent in 2022, largely due to a decrease in fulfillment network investments.Amazon recently completed a majoroverhaul of its fulfillment operationsto reduce complexity and cost, while still boosting delivery speeds for its Prime members. Instead of operating one national network, it will now oversee eight regional, interconnected hubs.Dive Insight:Amazon has slashed costs across its businesses as it contends with stagnating demand and an inflationary environment. Beyond restructuring its fulfillment network, the e-commerce giant cut tens of thousands ofcorporate jobsand shuttered certain business, including physical bookstores and itshealthcare delivery service.Overhauling operations has begun to pay off, particularly in fulfillment. CEO Andy Jassy said on the call the company is “bullish on the early results” of its shift to a regional fulfillment model, noting inventory is closer to customers.“Not surprisingly, shorter travel distances means lower cost to serve and customers getting their orders faster,” he said.Amazon expanded its fulfillment footprint at a breakneck pace during the pandemic, but operating one massive network became “inefficient in a significant way,” Jassy said.Spiraling fulfillment costs “caused us to really reevaluate virtually everything we do in operations over the last six to nine months,” Jassy noted, saying that the company has found a number of opportunities to streamline costs and boost profits.“We have found a lot more opportunities than we even thought were there before,” Jassy said. “So, I’m pretty optimistic that we have a chance not just to recover to where we were pre-pandemic in terms of operating margin, but I think there’s additional upside with some of the opportunities we’ve identified.”",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-to-slow-fulfillment-spend-as-it-prioritizes-regional-model/648958/,True

Adore Me's uphill battle against fakes on Amazon,"Published July 7, 2022","A few years ago, Adore Me, likemany other popular brands, found that proprietary images of its merchandise were increasingly being featured on Amazon under sometimes misleading seller names like “Adome.”It’s not a new problem at Amazon. Counterfeiting there has been afocus of federal regulators and Congressfor years. The company has been on the receiving end of warnings from the U.S. Trade Representative more than once, for example. And founder and then-CEO Jeff Bezos was hauledin front of the House Judiciary Committeeover the issue in 2020.“Amazon is a very competitive arena, using both what we might call white-hat and black-hat tactics. This is clearly on the more black-hat side of things,”Rick Watson, founder and CEO of RMW Commerce Consulting, said by phone. “For Amazon, this is the cost of doing business. As long as it doesn't take over the site, they're not too concerned about it. Not to say that they're not concerned at all, but that's their point of view. It's not like this is happening to 10% of sellers – it’s like an edge case.And it's not always easy to get resolved because you have to file cases and submit reports and sometimes it could take months to get some kind of resolution.”That’s what played out at Adore Me. Alarmed that other sellers were benefiting from its branding, the decade-old DTC lingerie retailer reached out to the e-commerce giant, via an email system set up for such complaints.“We would try to have these things taken down and the Amazon process — it's not a definitive ‘No, we will not take this action on your behalf.’ It's more like, ‘More information is needed,’ and kind of being circled around,” Adore Me Vice President of Strategy Ranjan Roy said via video conference call.If Amazon did deem the grievance justified it would strike the listings, as seen in a 2019 email exchange between the companies that was viewed by Retail Dive. But those offenders would resurface almost immediately, using the same images and sometimes Adore Me product names, Roy said.Adore Me has struggled to remove listings like this one from an Amazon seller (left) that uses one of its proprietary images (right) and sometimes its product names and other details.Permission granted by Adore MeAdore Me, reluctant Amazon sellerGrowing more leery of losing customers to imposters, the brand decided to sell on Amazon itself. After testing a few products on the site, Adore Me in April opened an Amazon storefront, a step taken grudgingly because it has invested in tight control of its operations, including running two highly automated fulfillment centers and custom-building its tech infrastructure.“For us, owning as much of the customer relationship — the tech stack, the logistics, everything — is what gives us good economics and makes the overall customer experience better,” Roy said. “But we finally got to the point that, if someone searched ‘Adore Me’ on Amazon, one of the counterfeit brands would show up, and we almost had to put up a storefront just to at least keep that customer who's interested in us.”""We finally got to the point that, if someone searched ‘Adore Me’ on Amazon, one of the counterfeit brands would show up, and we almost had to put up a storefront just to at least keep that customer who’s interested in us.”Ranjan RoyVice President of Strategy, Adore MeAdore Me also hoped that becoming an Amazon seller might elevate its complaints. Yet the brand has been relegated to communicating via Amazon’s online Seller Central portal and has been unable to get anyone from Amazon on the phone. Roy calls the process “time consuming, cumbersome and ineffective.”In an email, an Amazon spokesperson shared background information on the company’s brand protection efforts, including the use of automated technology to constantly monitor its site forpotential infringement the moment a product is listed. After Retail Dive’s inquiry into Adore Me’s situation, the Amazon spokesperson said that the e-retail giant got in touch with the lingerie brand.“We have identified and taken appropriate action against product listings that infringed on Adore Me’s intellectual property, and have reached out to the brand to understand and investigate their most recent concerns,” the Amazon spokesperson said.Adore Me confirmed that Amazon’s “Brand Escalation” team reached out by emailon Tuesdayto schedule a call, saying they were “made aware” of Adore Me’s difficulty resolving IP issues on Amazon.MotivationsRoy said he believes that inquiries from the press drive Amazon, allowing it to respond on an as-needed basis to avoid negative attention. But the primary reason Amazon may be reluctant to pursue these cases too aggressively is that it wants the sales the fakes provide, he also said. Amazon didn't immediately respond to a request for information on how much revenue or product sales the company receives from counterfeits, or what the impact to its retail performance would be if all counterfeits were eliminated from its site.In its most recent quarter,Amazon’s online retail sales fell 3%year over year to $51.1 billion, as its net product sales fell 1.8%.""We have identified and taken appropriate action against product listings that infringed on Adore Me’s intellectual property, and have reached out to the brand.""SpokespersonAmazon public relations“The biggest thing to me is it’s fully in Amazon's interest to not solve this problem,” Roy said. “Why would they when, the more of these types of sellers there are, the more they generate sales and revenue? It's completely not in their best interest to try to solve this. Some level of regulation, policymaking, enforcement — outside of Amazon — needs to take place. From a competition standpoint, it's brands like us, that are growing and have our own website and customers, who have to devote our own time to actually policing this, and not even getting the right results, and now actually have to be on Amazon.”As a brand now with a storefront on Amazon, Adore Me is also cognizant that Amazon itself facesclaims from AllbirdsandPeak Designthat the e-retailer’s Amazon Basics line copied their designs, Roy said.MethodsLast year, Amazon’s automated technology each day scanned more than 8 billion changes to product detail pages for signs of potential abuse, up from 5 billion in 2020. The company blocked more than 4 billion bad listings — suspected of being somehow fraudulent, of significant poor quality or otherwise improper — before they could be listed, according to information provided in an email.But sophisticated tech alone isn’t the answer, according to Adore Me’s Roy.“The biggest thing to me is it’s fully in Amazon's interest to not solve this problem. Some level of regulation, policymaking, enforcement — outside of Amazon — needs to take place.""Ranjan RoyVice President of Strategy, Adore Me“This stuff requires human interaction, a real person,” he said. “Again, when you look at ‘Adome’ and you look at “Adore Me’ you see it right away. It's not a question. But if that process is, probably by design, not going to be aggressively removing things, it can never work. I 100% believe this needs to be a much more high-touch, human process.”Amazon does employ “more than 12,000 people – including machine learning scientists, software developers, and expert investigators – who are dedicated to protecting customers, brands, selling partners, and our store from counterfeit, fraud, and other forms of abuse,” an Amazon spokesperson said by email.Roy isn’t impressed with that number, calling it a “clear head fake” for a company with a $1.1 trillion market cap and hundreds of billions in annual sales. Even 12 million would be inadequate, as long as Amazon profits from fakes and deception, he also said.“It might sound like a large number, but in the scale of their business, it is clearly not,” he said by email. “Even small online businesses have a direct phone number. ... Amazon makes money on FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon), and because of that, they get to limit investment into stopping it. This makes it so that brands like us are left having to chase them, and journalists need to request commentary on the issue in order for them to take real action.”",https://www.retaildive.com/news/adoreme-battle-fakes-counterfeits-amazon/626497/,True
Federal judge orders Amazon to cease and desist anti-labor practices,"Published Nov. 22, 2022","Dive Brief:Amazon committed unfair business practices at a Staten Island facility thatvoted to unionizeearlier this year, U.S. District Judge Diane Gujarati of the Eastern District of New York ruled on Friday. The company must cease and desist from firing workers who engage in protected activity and from “interfering with, restraining, or coercing employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed” to them by labor law, Gujarati wrote.However, she declined to reinstate Gerald Bryson, an employee who was fired after advocating for better protections againstCOVID-19 at the Staten Island warehouse, known as JFK8, according to court documents.Neither Amazon nor the Amazon Labor Union, which successfully unionized the facility, immediately returned requests for comment on the mixed decision.Dive Insight:Judge Gujarati’s determination not only requires Amazon to cease and desist firing employees who participate in protected activities but also to post and read aloud her ruling at the JFK8 warehouse.Her refusal to give Bryson his job back runs counter to a decision from an NLRB administrative law judge, however. Judge Benjamin Green in April reinstated Bryson with back pay, ruling that his dismissal was a form of retaliation. In May Amazon appealed, and the matter is now before a five-member NLRB appellate panel. On Friday, Gujarati said there’s no evidence “that Bryson’s termination continues to have any appreciable effect on the ALU’s efforts or on employee willingness to engage in protected concerted activity.”“Furthermore, given that Bryson was terminated approximately one year before the ALU was formed, this case is distinguishable from cases where union activists were terminated contemporaneous with their union activity and a diminution of union support was shown to exist following the termination,” she also said.That makes little sense, and Bryson is likely to regain his post after the NLRB panel rules, according to Ellen Dichner, a professor at the City University of New York’s School of Labor & Urban Studies.“Judge Green found very, very firmly that there was an unfair labor practice and recommended immediate reinstatement,” she said by phone.The NLRB process runs independently of the district court, Dichner said. Amazon could appeal Gujarati’s finding that its actions run afoul of labor law,shenoted. The e-commerce giant didn’t immediately reply to a question about whether it would.“I have to tell you, I don't understand this decision,”Dichnersaid of the district court. “Generally, if a judge finds reasonable cause and orders a cease and desist, there's an understanding of the law that when it's known to employees that one of the major activists was fired for engaging in concerted activity over health and safety conditions or in support of the union, that chills the exercise of rights by other employees. Employees react to discharges of activists. They may even vote yes for the union, but they're not going to stand out as open activists out of fear the same thing could happen to them.”In a historic vote in April labor organizers prevailed at the JFK8 facility, a victory the e-commerce giant tried andfailed to overturn. Amazon has overcome most union votes at its facilities so far, however. The law provides leeway for companies to educate their workers about what they believe will occur if they organize, and last year Amazon paid consultants nearly $4.3 million in cash tohelp it defeat such efforts.But the company has also crossed the line, according to the NLRB. Last month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wassummoned to appearbefore the agency in February after he stated in media interviews that joining a union would disadvantage employees and that their relationships with supervisors are better when they’re not part of a union. Those comments amount to “interfering with, restraining, and coercing employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed” under federal labor law, according to an Oct. 25 letter to Jassy from NLRB Regional Director Ronald Hooks.",https://www.retaildive.com/news/federal-judge-orders-amazon-to-cease-and-desist-anti-labor-practices/637069/,False
Amazon bringing new and improved Dash Carts to Whole Foods,"Published July 13, 2022","Dive Brief:Amazon will roll out updated Dash Carts at several Whole Foods Market stores in the coming months, according to acompany blog postMonday, continuing the infusion of checkout technology into the specialty grocery store.The new carts hold four bags of groceries — double the capacity of the previous version. They can also roll out to shoppers’ cars and feature an extended battery life.Despite itsrecent focuson Just Walk Out frictionless technology at Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods stores, this latest announcement indicates Amazon is still bullish on the prospects of its proprietary smart cart.Dive Insight:In his blog post, Dilip Kumar, Amazon’s vice president of physical retail and technology, said the company will add its revamped Dash Cart to a Whole Foods in Westford, Massachusetts, sometime in the next few months before rolling it out to “a few” additional Whole Foods stores and “many” Amazon Fresh stores.The smart carts, whichdebuted in 2020at the first Amazon Fresh store in Woodland Hills, California, automatically recognize products as shoppers place them inside and feature a running total of the items selected as they shop. The carts now appear in around half of the grocery chain’s 35 stores, while the rest of the locations offer Amazon’s Just Walk Out frictionless checkout technology.By updating the Dash Cart, Amazon is bringing the technology more in line with a traditional shopping cart that shoppers are accustomed to. The latest Dash Cart weighs less than the previous version despite having double the carrying capacity. It features a shelf for delicate items and storage beneath the cart for bulky products. Kumar noted the carts more precisely track a customer’s journey through the store, and can show images of nearby items on the digital screen.Whereas the previous version of the Dash Cart isn’t permitted to enter store parking lots, the latest version allows shoppers to take it to their cars to unload. Kumar said the new carts are “weather resistant,” with the technology having been tested inside ovens and freezers, and heavy weights dropped inside the cart more than 100,000 times.To use the latest Dash Cart, shoppers scan in with a QR code through the Amazon or Whole Foods Market app, then scan items using one of the cameras located near the cart’s handle. The cart’s computer vision algorithms and sensor fusion technology help recognize each item as it’s scanned in or removed from the cart. Once finished, shoppers exit through the Dash Cart lane and their card on file is automatically charged.Grocers have been carefully testing smart carts as they look for ways to merge digital and physical shopping. The carts are expensive, and their effectiveness at scale has yet to be proven, but they promise a faster checkout experience for shoppers and, perhaps most importantly, can help retailerstrack their journey through storeswhile also serving up advertisements to them.Last year, Instacartbought smart cart maker Caper AI.

"In latest sign of shifting priorities, Amazon reportedly freezes corporate hiring in its retail operations","Published Oct. 5, 2022","Dive Brief:Amazon has frozen corporate hiringin its retail businessuntil some time early in 2023, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. The e-commerce giant didn’t dispute the report, but said it’s still hiring in certain areas.“Amazon continues to have a significant number of open roles available across the company,” Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser said by email. “We have many different businesses at various stages of evolution, and we expect to keep adjusting our hiring strategies in each of these businesses at various junctures.”The company’sretail sales have declinedall year as expenses have surged, helping to push it into the red in the most recent quarter, and some analysts believe its Prime membership shows signs of plateauing.Dive Insight:Amazon has arguably been pulling back from its retail business for a while, increasingly relying on enterprises more lucrative than selling merchandise. In fact for years now its third-party marketplace has been responsible for nearly two-thirds of the goods sold on its site, with seller fees providing a rich source of revenue growth.For even longer, its AWS cloud computing unit has been the company’s profit center. The company has alsorecently been striking dealswith other retailers to leverage its “just walk out” in-store payment tech. And advertising has emerged as a growth vehicle: Amazon executives in July said the company is working on more ways to leverage ads, including via livestreaming, and video and music streaming.In its most recent quarter, subscription sales rose 10%, seller services revenue rose 9.1% and advertising sales rose 17.5%, while retail sales fell 4.3%. The e-retailer, which has relied on its annual Prime Day sale tostoke its membership baseand supercharge sales, for the first time isholding a secondsuch event this month.The company earlier this yearshuttered all itsbookstoresand 4-star general merchandise stores. Its downsizing isn’t limited to brick-and-mortar retail, however, as the company has canceled or delayeddozens of warehouses, just months after Amazon Chief Financial OfficerBrian Olsavskytold analysts that the company would mitigate the burgeoning costs of its ambitious capacity expansion bygrowing into it as early as this year.The retail hiring freeze could be a consequence of over-hiring during the height of the pandemic, a corollary to the over-building of its warehouse capacity. Both were over-reactions to what turned out to be an unsustainable surge of demand in e-commerce, according to Erik Gordon, professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.“They drew a straight line up, when in fact that line has leveled off,” he said by phone.But it could also reflect a sense at Amazon that its potential for dramatic growth now lies outside of retail, in part because retailers have learned how to compete. Thanks to BOPIS, shopping locally even for staples is often preferable to waiting on Amazon’s swiftest delivery time; meanwhile, many consumers won't shop on Amazon when it’s important to find an item that’s unique or, despite its efforts to fight counterfeits, genuine, he said.Amazon isn’t leaving the retail business, but it hasn’t excelled at it either, according to Paula Rosenblum, co-founder and managing partner at RSR Research.“Amazon is a retailer, just not a particularly good one,” she said by email. “Certainly it has never been a profitable one. AWS floats the business, and the marketplace helps stem the losses. At brick and mortar, I can be even more definitive…the company doesn’t know how to do it in a practical way at all.”",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-reportedly-freezes-corporate-hiring-retail-operations/633352/,True

Clark isleaving Amazon July 1to become chief executive of supply chain technology startup Flexport.Amazon is elevating Herrington as the company strives to boost its financial performance and become more efficient in the face of inflation, rising labor costs andother headwinds.Dive Insight:Herrington brings a wealth of online retail experience to his new role, which will put him in charge of a large chunk of Amazon’s operations, including the delivery infrastructure that sits at the heart of the e-commerce giant’s business.Herrington has served as senior vice president of Amazon’s North American consumer operations since 2015, according to his LinkedIn profile. He launched the company’s AmazonFresh grocery business in 2007, two years after joining the company to develop its consumables business, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in announcing Herrington’s appointment.AmazonFresh, which began as a small-scale service in Seattle and expanded to Los Angeles in 2013, formed the foundation of the grocery-delivery business and subsequent store chain that Amazon runs today.“He is a builder of great teams and brings substantial retail, grocery, demand generation, product development, and Amazon experience to bear,” Jassy said in a statement about Herrington’s appointment.Herrington’s career in e-commerce is rooted in his experience as anexecutive of Webvan, the high-profile grocery e-commerce pioneer that wound up in bankruptcy in 2001. Before joining Webvan in 1998, Herrington worked for consulting firm Booz Allen and Hamiliton, where he was a partner in the retailing, consumer products and media group for nearly a decade.Jassy said he believes Amazon has a long runway for growth as an online retailer, noting that the company’s sales represent just 1% of the worldwide retail market, which he pointed out is mostly comprised of sales at brick-and-mortar stores.At the same time, Amazon is trying to figure out how to compete in brick-and-mortar retail. The company earlier this yearclosed downits 4-Star, Books and Pop Up stores and said it will focus on its Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market, Amazon Go, Amazon Style stores and Just Walk Out technology.“If you believe that equation will change over time (which I do), there’s *a lot* of potential for us as we continue to be laser-focused on providing the best customer experience (broadest selection, low prices, fast and convenient delivery) while working on our cost structure to have the right long-term business,” Jassy said in the announcement.",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-names-grocery-veteran-to-head-consumer-business/625866/,True
Amazon to close 8 of its Go stores,"Published March 6, 2023","Dive Brief:Amazon is permanently closing eight Go convenience stores — two in Seattle, two in New York City and four in San Francisco — on April 1, a spokesperson from the company said in an email.Despite these closures, the company will “continue to open new Amazon Go stores,” and is “working closely with all affected employees to identify new roles” within the organization, the spokesperson said.Amazon shuttering more than a quarter of its Go stores highlightsthe company's ongoing challenges in building its physical retail footprint. About a month ago, itpaused the rolloutof its Fresh grocery stores.Dive Insight:Amazon’s decision to close several of its Go stores comes just weeks after it openeda location in Puyallup, Washington, that follows itslarger suburban-focused format. The retailer also opened a number of locations last year in Southern California. As of last month, Amazon operated 31 Go stores in total.With these closures, the company will have 23 Go stores, the spokesperson said.When asked why Amazon has decided to shutter the eight stores in Seattle, New York City and San Francisco, the spokesperson said that like with any retailer, Amazon periodically assesses its portfolio of stores and makes optimization decisions along the way.“We remain committed to the Amazon Go format, operate more than 20 Amazon Go stores across the U.S., and will continue to learn which locations and features resonate most with customers as we keep evolving our Amazon Go stores,” the spokesperson said.The closures continue a recent flurry of setbacks for Amazon’s physical retail segment. In early February, CEO Andy Jassy said during the company's earnings call that Amazon was halting its Fresh grocery store rollout as it figures out a way to better differentiate and improve its economics.At the time,the company said it would close some Fresh and Go locations, but didn’t indicate how many.Amazon reporteda 6% rise in physical store sales during Q4, according to its earnings report.The high-flying e-commerce company has been in cost-cutting mode lately.Dating back to November of last year, Amazon has undertaken aseries of layoffs— mainly for its retail employees — that has included 18,000 roles.Amazon debuted its first cashierless Go store in Seattle in 2018.

Forrester Principal Analyst Sucharita Kodalieven called the notion “idiotic”given Amazon’s tendency to poach from its sellers, saying that Walmart, Target and others would all be superior ideas.Kodali hasn’t warmed to the idea after all this time. “Gap is not operating from a position of strength and desperate times call for desperate measures,” she said by email Friday. “Something like this is a Hail Mary pass that is more about the challenged situation of the company than a brilliant strategic move.”Gap seems to be running out of ideas as its sales continue to plummet.

Amazon dangles free Grubhub membership ahead of Prime Day,"Published July 6, 2022","Dive Brief:Thanks to an agreement announced Wednesday,Amazon has an opportunity to take a 2% stakein Dutch restaurant delivery company Just Eat Takeaway.com, which runs Grubhub and other food delivery operations in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Europe and elsewhere.That could grow to 15%, “subject to the satisfaction of certain performance conditions, principally the number of new consumers delivered through the commercial agreement,” according to a Just Eat Takeaway press release.As part of the newly inked partnership, Amazon as of Wednesday isoffering U.S. Prime members a free year-long Grubhub+ membership, with no delivery fees on orders over $12, according to press releases from both companies.Dive Insight:Grubhub has struggled to gain traction in a fiercely competitive food delivery market, and Just Eat Takeaway has beeneager to sellthe service, just two years after acquiring it. As it announced its new partnership with Amazon, the company reiterated that it “continues to actively explore the partial or full sale of Grubhub.”It’s unclear whether the e-commerce giant would buy a stake of any size in what has been a money-losing enterprise. Orders have also tapered off as consumers head back to dine in restaurants themselvesand, at the same time, rein in their spending asgas and groceriesmore quickly empty their wallets. In the first quarter, Just Eat Takeaway’s order growth in North America fell 5% from the previous quarter to 89.6 million orders.But the tie-up does give existing and prospective Prime members in the U.S. a new perk just ahead of Amazon’s midsummer Prime Day sales event. Prime members in more than 4,000 cities in the U.S., amounting to “hundreds of thousands of restaurants across the country,” can use their newGrubhub membership, Amazon said.If there’s a boost from that, it may be quite helpful, given that interest in Prime Day was already waning last yearas more retailers encroachedon the made-up sales holiday. This year inflation has also introduced a newlayer of uncertainty: Shoppers in search of deals could be attracted to the sale, but they’re also being extra cautious about discretionary spending.Amazon is piling on other special perks for Prime Day as well, per its release. Only Prime members can access the sale or its perks, including a minute-long sneak peek of its upcoming “The Lord of the Rings” television series, deals tied to the launch of Thursday Night Football and special experiences for gamersahead of a battle featuring MrBeast and Ninja.",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-free-grubhub-membership-ahead-of-prime-day/626634/,True
Shopify execs say Deliverr is key in building fulfillment network distinct from Amazon,"Published March 16, 2023","Dive Brief:Shopify's integration of Deliverr will help the company build out its fulfillment capabilities for merchants in a more cost-effective manner, CFO Jeff Hoffmeister said atMorgan Stanley's Technology, Media and Telecom Conferencelast week.The addition of Deliverr, an e-commerce fulfillment and order storage provider, provides Shopify with an asset-light network of warehouse partners, along with carriers and last-mile providers. Hoffmeister said partners can help core hub operations and areas where inventory is located ""on the edge of the network.""""Some of the technology we got from Deliverr allows us to do this in a distributed way, and then tackle some things which Amazon and others have in terms of problems we don't have,"" Hoffmeister added. Amazon has recently grappled with elevated operating costs andexcess capacitythroughout its logistics network.Dive Insight:Building a fulfillment network that can serve both the needs of merchants and delivery expectations of consumers is an expensive and lengthy undertaking. But Shopify leaders say the purchase of Deliverr is accelerating progress in that area as it looks to provide services to merchantsthroughout the supply chain.""With Deliverr, what they're bringing is a network and fulfillment management software layer, which helps to predict demand and place inventory at a point that is closest to that demand,"" Senior Manager of Investor Relations Ana Raman saidat a separate conference last week. ""And by doing that, we believe that we can decrease the time to which we can get a product to the end customer, and thereby reduce cost as well.""While the size of competitor Amazon's fulfillment network remainsunrivaled in the e-commerce space, it has struggled under the weight of fixed costs. Amazon rapidly expanded its distribution network during a boom in e-commerce sales, but growth slowed in 2022, resulting in excess warehouse capacity and inefficiencies.The fulfillment network that Shopify is building is much different than what other companies have, President Harley Finkelstein said. He pointed to Amazon operating a single network with millions of SKUs within it as a model Shopify isn't interested in emulating.""What we're trying to build instead is, what if we created a lot of small networks with 20 SKUs, like Allbirds for example,"" Finkelstein said. ""You can pick a hoodie, a pair of sneakers and a pair of sandals. That is a much easier thing for us to do and it's a lot less capital intensive.""Deliverr providing access to ""elastic warehouse capacity"" will advance Shopify's fulfillment network vision, but it will take time for the company to fully realize the acquisition's benefits. Deliverr users currently make up ""a very, very small percentage"" of Shopify's overall merchant base, Hoffmeister said, which the company aims to change once the integration is complete.""Part of the opportunity for us is once we do have Deliverr fully integrated to ramp that and get more and more of our merchants using Deliverr,"" Hoffmeister said.",https://www.retaildive.com/news/shopify-deliverr-building-fulfillment-network-distinct-amazon/645137/,False
Amazon scrutinizing unprofitable business units: WSJ,"Published Nov. 10, 2022","Dive Brief:Amazon isscrutinizing its expensesand scaling back unprofitable enterprises, much of that centered on its retail-related operations, including its Alexa virtual assistant, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal Thursday.Employees in certain divisions have been told to seek jobs elsewhere, according to the report. The e-commerce giant last month reportedlyfroze corporate hiringin its retail business, laterexpanding thatcompany-wide. Earlier this year company alsopulled backon a planned warehouse expansion.The economy is impacting the company’s decisions, Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser said in an emailed statement.“We remain excited about the future of our larger businesses, as well as newer initiatives like Prime Video, Alexa, Grocery, Kuiper, Zoox, and Healthcare,” Glasser said. “Our senior leadership team regularly reviews our investment outlook and financial performance, including as part of our annual operating plan review, which occurs in the fall each year. As part of this year's review, we're of course taking into account the current macro-environment and considering opportunities to optimize costs.”Dive Insight:Amazon joins other big companies, especially in the tech sector, in moving assertively to contain costs during a moment of economic uncertainty. The company must also unwind some expansion plans it made as e-commerce surged during the height of the pandemic, only to quiet down as consumers returned to their more normal lifestyles.The company increasingly derives its strongest revenue growth from advertising, subscriptions, logistics and itsAWScloud servicerather than retail sales of goods. In late October, the company warned thatprofits could be as low as zeroin the fourth quarter.All companies in any industry should conduct cost reviews each year, regardless of the state of the economy, according to Forrester Principal Analyst Brendan Witcher.“In fact, it’s a practice most retailers do, but because it’s Amazon it’s suddenly newsworthy,” he said by email. “The more important part of this story that folks should remember is that Amazon has rarely had a misstep in overreacting to short-term market conditions. While other retailers tend to shoot themselves in the foot by overreacting and having torecorrectagain later, Amazon tends to make cost cutting moves that don’t put them in a position that they have to readjust the following year.”The e-commerce giant is being shepherded by a chief executive, Andy Jassy, who took overfrom founder Jeff Bezosa little over a year ago. Jassy inherited a company that, thanks to a mindset of constant innovation and no fear of failure, has become a sprawling conglomerate in the last decade, according to GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders.“This sort of thinking – which is the hallmark of JeffBezos– was to ensure that Amazon remained at the forefront of new trends by experimenting with different ideas that may becomeaccretiveto its business,” he said in emailed comments.Jassy is keen to slash costs and prioritize profits, sources told the Wall Street Journal. That’s a necessary correction now that the economy is uncooperative. It’s also a complex endeavor because Amazon has grown so large and disparate, and because loss-makers like Alexa are important to Amazon’s successful ecosystem, Saunders said.“This means cutting must be done with surgical precision rather than by taking a hatchet to the business,” he said. “Amazon must also take care to ensure it doesn’t stifle the spirit of innovation which has, for a long time, allowed it to advance in areas like retail. In our view, once the review process is concluded Amazon would benefit from setting out a clear plan for how it intends to grow to show investors it has a good sense of future direction that goes beyond trying to cut its way to profitability.”",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-scrutinizing-unprofitable-business-units-wsj/636276/,True

"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy’s comments on unions run afoul of labor laws, federal agency says","Published Oct. 28, 2022","Dive Brief:Amazon CEO Andy Jassy must answer to the National Labor Relations Board for assertions made during media interviews earlier this year that joining a union would put employees at a disadvantage at the company and that their relationships with supervisors would be better if they’re not part of a union.In doing so, Jassy “has been interfering with, restraining, and coercing employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed” under federal labor law, according to an Oct. 25 letter to Jassy from NLRB Regional Director Ronald Hooks. A hearing on the matter, which is based on a complaint from the Amazon Labor Union, isscheduled for Feb. 7.Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel defended Jassy’s comments as a lawful explanation of the company’s views on unions. “These allegations are completely without merit, and the comments in question are clearly protected by express language of the National Labor Relations Act and decades of NLRB precedent,” Nantel said in an emailed statement.Dive Insight:The charges outlined in the NLRB complaint cite statements Jassy made during interviews with CNBC and Bloomberg.In anApril interview with CNBC, he said that if employees were represented by a union they would be less empowered in the workplace, that it would be more difficult for them to have direct relationships with management and that things would be done less quickly and more bureaucratically, according to the agency’s letter. And in hisJune interview with Bloomberg, he made similar comments and also stated that “employees are better off without a union,” per the letter.Amazon characterizes those remarks as benign.“The comments lawfully explain Amazon’s views on unionization and the way it could affect the ability of our employees to deal directly with their managers, and they began with a clear recognition of our employees’ right to organize and in no way contained threats of reprisal,” Amazon’sNantelsaid in the statement. “We believe our employees, their families, and other stakeholders benefit from a full understanding of the facts on important topics like this. We’re committed to ensuring everyone understands our perspective and to explaining it respectfully and transparently.”But Jassy made them in what is anew era for labor organization, with rising approval from Americans, especially younger ones, and enforcement from an NLRB newly emboldened by the Biden administration. The current stance of the NLRB and the high-profile nature of union efforts at big chains like Starbucks and at Amazon itself make it more likely that unions will file complaints like this, triggering the kind of actions that Jassy now faces, according to John Logan, professor at the Lam Family College of Business at San Francisco State University and an expert in labor and anti-labor activities.There’s a strong case that Jassy’s comments could be construed by workers as a threat to their job situation, just as they would be if a direct supervisor made them on the warehouse floor, Logan said by phone.“There's no question that Jassy and [Starbucks CEO Howard] Shultz are trying to send a message to employees that either unionization is futile and that we’ll never give up our opposition to the union — things that clearly could constitute allegations of unlawful coercion, and that if said face to face to an employee in the context of an organizing campaign would be unlawful,” Logan said. “Whether they're said by the CEO in the context of a speech or interview, or if they're said by a district manager or warehouse manager in the context of a union campaign, you can make a very strong argument that, either way, the workers will hear these comments or they will get to know about them, and that potentially will have a very chilling impact on the union drive.”But JonathanHyman, an attorney at law firmWickensHerzerPanza who specializes in management-side labor and employment law, sees it as a difficult case for the union to make. Like Amazon, he sees Jassy’s comments as general statements about how the employer-employee relationship could change if a workplace unionizes. And the union must prove that Jassy intended to threaten or intimidate employees, he said by email.“I’ll note, however, that NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo has made statements about ‘direct relationships’ between employees and management being on her kill list,” he said. “All things being equal, I think Amazon has the better of these arguments, but with this NLRB, all bets are off.”",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-comments-unions-federal-labor-laws/635173/,False

With both retailers and their customers aware of supply chain problems, expect more retailers to join the early holiday rush, according to researchers at deals site BlackFriday.com.

More than half said they’ll probably start early to be sure to get what they want, according to that report.Amazon, Target and other retailers with early sales will capture some attention, but in some ways the holidays this year will be more traditional as more consumers shop in stores, according toNPDchief retail industry adviser Marshal Cohen.“At the same time, more normalcy is resurfacing, and the consumer excitement to get into stores for the deal-hunting they have missed over the past two years is capable of sparking increased activity for retailers who create a sense of urgency around the more traditional peak days for in-store traffic,” Cohen said in a statement.",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-target-kick-off-holiday-sales-early/632632/,True

Amazon to acquire iRobot for $1.7B,"Published Aug. 5, 2022","Dive Brief:Expanding its reach into the homes of consumers, Amazon announced a definitive agreement on Friday toacquire the robot companyiRobotfor $1.7 billionin cash, according to a press release.The robot company is known for its automatic home vacuum, the Roomba, and specializes in “technologies and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation,” per the release.Amazon already owns several in-home technologies, such as the Alexa assistant devices and itsRingandBlinksecurity devices. The company plans to invent new ways to make customers’ lives easier with the iRobot team, according to the press release.Dive Insight:The latest addition to Amazon’s technology portfolio means the retailer is moving into the home in more ways than one.“We know that saving time matters, and chores take precious time that can be better spent doing something that customers love,” Dave Limp, senior vice president of Amazon Devices, said in a statement. “Over many years, the iRobot team has proven its ability to reinvent how people clean with products that are incredibly practical and inventive — from cleaning when and where customers want while avoiding common obstacles in the home, to automatically emptying the collection bin.”It’s a move that could create concerns for some consumers, who might already be weary of Amazon’s data collection capabilities.“The one big downside comes from privacy concerns. While Amazon does not use data in a malicious way, some people will worry about how much data is being gathered about their homes and lives through the presence of a greater number of smart devices,” GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said in emailed comments. “Amazon will need to work hard to satisfy both consumers and regulators that it is doing right by the increasing volume of personal information it has at its disposal.”While Amazon has beencriticized recentlywith how it uses customer information, the company said in a statement emailed to Retail Dive that “we think we’ve been very good stewards of peoples’ data across all of our business.”Amazon is no stranger to automation though, as it has been focused on bringing autonomous innovation to its fulfillment and delivery operations — a space that might benefit from the navigation and mapping technology iRobot brings.

Amazon leans on non-retail business as e-commerce sales fall for the second straight quarter,"Published July 29, 2022","Dive Brief:Amazon’s online retail sales, which include store-based grocery delivery or pickup, dropped for the second straight quarter, falling 4.3% in Q2 to $50.9 billion.Partly due to higher grocery prices, physical store sales rose 12.5% to $4.7 billion.The e-commerce giant’s operating expenses rose 11.9% to $117.9 billion, according to a company press release. That helped push its operating income down 56.9% year over year to $3.3 billion. Amazonnotched another net loss, (including apre-tax valuation loss of $3.9 billion from its investment in EV companyRivianAutomotive),this time reaching $2 billion from last year’s net income of $7.8 billion.Amazon made up for its e-commerce decline mainly through fees from Prime customers and marketplace sellers: Subscription sales rose 10% to $8.7 billion, seller services revenue rose 9.1% to $27.4 billion and advertising sales rose 17.5% to $8.8 billion.Dive Insight:Amazon’s retail e-commerce site increasingly seems less like a retail endeavor and more like the fulcrum upon which more lucrative enterprises rest. Including its AWS cloud unit and other services, the company’s net sales rose 7% to $121.2 billion.Its marketplace is gaining in importance, as third-party sellers accounted for 57% of all units sold on Amazon in the quarter, the highest percentage ever, Chief Financial Officer BrianOlsavskytold analysts Thursday. The company is also working on more ways to make money from advertising, including via its streaming services including Twitch, and Amazon video and music, according to Dave Fildes, the company’s director of investor relations.“While Amazon’s retail business has softened, it has made up for the weakness with services,” GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said in emailed comments. However, Prime subscription revenue growth slowed from last quarter’s 13% rise, which according to GlobalData was “a significant deterioration from the average quarterly growth rate of 30.5% over the last three years.”Wells Fargo analysts noted that the Prime program may be reaching a saturation point, at least in areas where it’s been available for a while.The company’s net loss isn’t all down to Rivian, either, according to Saunders, who called the net losses “eyewatering.” Amazon’s retail-related operating losses included $627 million in North America and $1.8 billion abroad, he said.“These are masked by the $5.7 billion operating income from AWS, but they nevertheless show that Amazon is suffering from the same fate as players like Walmart and Target — namely that costs are outpacing sales growth by quite some margin,” he said.Still, the company’s year-over-year comparisons in coming quarters are set to ease up, since they won’t be up against the pandemic-related e-commerce surge or last year’s Prime Day — the latter dinged about 400 points from this year’s Q2 revenue,Olsavskysaid. And if,as rumored, the company decides to stage a second Prime Day, “Amazon has a chance to put out some better top line numbers,” according to Saunders. “That said, the economy and consumer sentiment is also deteriorating so, for Amazon to deliver, it will need to run very fast up a downward escalator.”",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-leans-on-non-retail-business-as-e-commerce-sales-fall-for-the-second/628426/,True
"Amazon audit reveals wage, benefit issues at 40% of potential suppliers","Published Aug. 16, 2022","Dive Brief:Amazonreportedthat 40.6% of its suppliers and potential partners audited last year had wage and benefits issues as the company works to strengthen relationships with suppliers and their workers.Although wage issues among audited suppliers are down from 47% in 2020, they remain comparable to 2019 rates, according to Amazon’s supplier assessment. Issues Amazon looks for include timely pay, overtime compensation and benefits that “satisfy applicable laws,” according to thecompany’s supply chain standards.The e-commerce giant routinely evaluates its suppliers to identify concerning practices, and works to address them through remediation efforts. However, Amazon’s sustainability webpage says it has “dedicated teams engaging directly with suppliers on safety-,  wage-, and working hours-related findings” to develop long-term corrective action plans.Dive Insight:Amazon is making some strides in its efforts to protect worker rights at its vendors after the e-commerce giant ramped up its transparency requirements for supplier operations.“We conduct regular assessments of suppliers of Amazon-branded products,” Amazon said on its sustainability webpage. “Where we see trends in issues beyond individual suppliers…we work to define regional or global strategies to address underlying systemic challenges.”Last year, the company added a tool to the assessment which required suppliers to “provide records and documentation in real time” to increase accuracy and, thereby, transparency. However, the lack of lead time caused transparency issues to rise in 2021, and suppliers now have advance notice of the expectation, Amazon said.The online retailer took its first major step towards transparency in 2019 when it published a list detailing the names and addresses of itsnearly 1,500 private label supplierson its website. TheHuman Rights Watch first asked Amazon to disclose layers of its supply chain in 2018.Amazon’s initial disclosure and ongoing transparency efforts with suppliers reflect a growing trend of companies attempting to achieve end-to-end visibility. A 2020 report prepared by Harvard Business Review Analytic Services for Basware found nearly 60% of business leaders say a lack of transparency between their finance and supplier practicespresents a risk to their business.Expanded transparency efforts have helped Amazon prioritize resources when problems arise among suppliers. The company broadened its remediation efforts to help suppliers build tools to help them respond to worker grievances inCambodia, China, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.“Amazon focuses on setting a high bar for new suppliers and refusing to go to production until suppliers remediate High-level findings,” the company said in its sustainability report. “We have dedicated teams based in key sourcing countries around the world that work directly with our suppliers to identify solutions to challenging problems and promote an open dialogue.”",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-adds-remediation-efforts-strengthen-supplier-relations/629696/,False
Teamsters labor union launches Amazon division,"Published Sept. 7, 2022","Dive Brief:In an effort to help unionize more Amazon employees, The International Brotherhood of Teamsters announced Tuesday the creation ofits Amazon Division, according to a press release.The division is dedicated to uniting Amazon workers and securing more workplace protections for them. It will be led by Randy Korgan, who brings three decades of organizing and industry experience.The Teamsters union is one of the U.S’s largest labor groups — consisting of 1.2 million members — and seeks to protect logistics workers at Amazon, which it claims is responsible for half of all workplace injuries in the warehouse sector “as its employees sustain serious injury at five times the national average,” per the release. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Retail Dive.Dive Insight:The Teamster’s announcement means Amazon’s battle with organization efforts just got more serious.“For 120 years, the Teamsters have proudly and ferociously protected transportation, logistics, and delivery workers, and we refuse to allow Amazon to continue to abuse and disrespect the more than one million Americans it employs,” Teamsters General President Sean O’Brien said in a statement. “Our new division affords a nationwide network of resources to all Amazon workers, behind the wheel of any truck or hard at work in any facility, to strategize with the union, mobilize in their communities, and succeed together.”The newscomes about a weekafter an officer with National Labor Relations Board recommended rejecting Amazon’s objection to a union vote in New York’s Staten Island. Thesuccessful voteat the New York warehouse in April had showed 2,654 votes cast in favor of unionizing to 2,131 against.Amazon is not the only retailer handling increased interest in unionization from employees.

Amazon sues 10K Facebook group admins over fake reviews,"Published July 20, 2022","Dive Brief:In a lawsuit filed Tuesday, Amazon accused administrators of more than 10,000 Facebook groups of coordinating to post fraudulent reviews on its platform to receive cash or free items,according to a company press release.These groups allegedly recruited members to receive incentives for fake reviews on Amazon stores in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, France, Japan and other countries, the company said.In the past year, Amazon has shut down a number of major review brokers targeting customers in the U.S. and abroad by taking legal action.Dive Insight:In its Tuesday statement, Amazon stressed the need for collaboration between companies, social media platforms and law enforcement to protect consumers in retail, travel and other sectors from fraudulent reviews. The company currently has over 12,000 employees devoted to detecting fake reviews and other forms of fraud and abuse.Amazon has reported more than 10,000 false review groups to Meta since 2020.Meta, which owns Facebook,WhatsAppand Instagram, has taken down more than half of these groups for violating its rules and is investigating more alleged fraudsters, according to the release.“Groups that solicit or encourage fake reviews violate our policies and are removed,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to Retail Dive. “We are working with Amazon on this matter and will continue to partner across the industry to address spam and fake reviews.”For years, Amazon has used the courts to target fraudulent reviewers and counterfeit sellers. In 2016, the e-commerce behemothsued three merchants for allegedlysharing positive reviewsabout their productsvia fake accounts. Earlier this year, the companyfiled lawsuits against AppSally and Rebatest, accusing the two sites of orchestrating the posting of fraudulent product reviews in exchange for free goods or money. The retailer has also teamed up withK.F.

Amazon Q1 retail sales flat as services drive growth,"Published April 28, 2023","Dive Brief:Amazon’sonline store sales were flatyear over year in Q1, reaching $51.1 billion, as physical store sales rose 7% to $4.9 billion. Product sales edged up less than 1% to $57 billion, per a company press release. Third-party marketplace sellers sold 59% of goods, up from 55% a year ago, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told analysts.Growth in services was stronger. Marketplace seller services rose 18% to $29.8 billion, subscriptions grew 15% to $9.7 billion and advertising grew 21% to $9.6 billion. The company’s AWS cloud services sales rose 16% to $21.4 billion. Total company net sales rose 9% to $127.4 billion.Expenses also rose, with cost of sales up 13% and fulfillment costs up 21%. The e-commerce giant swung into the black, with net income of $3.2 billion, (including AWS) versus last year’s $3.8 billon net loss. This year's net income included a pre-tax  loss of $0.5 billion from its investment in electric vehicle company Rivian Automotive; similarly the Q1 2021net loss was driven in part bya pre-tax loss of $7.6 billion from that investment.Dive Insight:Amazon’s cost-cutting efforts — includingmassive layoffsthat began at the end of last year and continuedthroughout the first quarter— are helping boost profits. But the e-commerce giant remains vulnerable to the consumer climate affecting all of retail, just as its highly profitable cloud services unit also slows.“We saw moderated spending on discretionary categories as well as shifts to lower-priced items and healthy demand in everyday essentials, such as consumables and beauty,”Olsavsky said on a call with analysts Thursday.Operating income at AWS, while it declined 21% to $5.1 billion in Q1, continues to prop up its retail operations: Overall operating income rose 30.1% to $4.8 billion.Sales at the company’s online store have slowed a bit, though it still overshadows its much smaller physical fleet of mostly Whole Foods grocery stores. That has led Amazon to rely more on its services for growth, according to GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders.The worry is that, as the economy tightens still further, spending in this area could come under more pressure,” he said in emailed comments.That includes advertising, which some analysts warncould be disrupting customer trust. On the call,CEO Andy Jassy said there is “a lot of upside still in advertising,” for a few reasons.“First, even in difficult economies, most people still shop,” he said. “And with the largest e-commerce shopping venue, we have a lot of customers that companies seek to reach. That, coupled with our very substantial investment in machine learning to make sure customers see relevant ads when they’re looking for various items, have meant that these advertisements have performed unusually well for brands, which makes them want to advertise on Amazon.”But the company, which GlobalData research shows has held on to most of its pandemic-related gains in market share, has more to do in the current climate, Saunders said.“In a slower growth environment, eking out market share gains requires much deeper thinking about how to better serve customers. Fortunately, we believe there are plenty of levers Amazon can pull across both the online experience and in its physical food stores,” he said. “Some of this has already been done in terms of expanding the offer in high-growth areas like beauty and focusing more on value from its own-brand products. However, other actions such making the website easier to shop and adding more inspiration to Whole Foods need to be addressed in the year ahead.”",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-q1-retail-sales-flat-AWS-growth/648867/,True
Amazon plans further improvements to Prime membership as Q4 sales slip,"Published Feb. 3, 2023","Dive Brief:Amazon continued to struggle in the holiday quarter, asproduct sales fell 1.2% to $70.5 billion. Online store sales fell 2.3% year over year to $64.5 billion, with physical stores (mostly Whole Foods) up 6% to $5 billion. Overall net sales, including the AWS cloud business, rose 9% to $149.2 billion.Retail-related services posted smaller gains than usual, per GlobalData analysts. From a year ago, revenue from third-party seller services rose 20%, subscription services rose 13% and advertising rose 19%, per Amazon’spress release. Marketplace sellers were responsible for a record 59% of unit sales, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told analysts during a conference call Thursday.Net income shrank 98% to $278 million, in part due to a pre-tax valuation loss of $2.3 billion from its Rivian Automotive investment, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For the full fiscal year, the e-commerce giant swung to a loss of $2.7 billion.Dive Insight:Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who just finished up his firstfull year at the helm, joined Olsavsky on the company’s earnings call Thursday, and sought to keep the focus on its strength and long-term potential.Analysts were preoccupied with slipping sales and margins in the company’s cloud business, which has traditionally helped support the less lucrative retail side. To buttress the retail business, the executives said they will bulk up what they noted is an already rich package of Prime membership perks — a streaming video service, gaming, photo storage, fast and free shipping, try-before-you-buy apparel shopping, the ability to use Primeat other retailersand a newprescription benefit.“We will continue to work very hard on those customer experiences, and we have a lot more planned,” Jassy said.While there have been reports that Primemembership growth is stallingin the U.S., the program “remains strong and so has the dollars purchased per Prime member,” though that “varies a bit by geography,” Olsavsky said. Despite cutbacks to its fulfillment capacity, the e-commerce giant is working to get back to its goal of one-day shipping for Prime members, he also said.Amazon’s enticing ecosystem couldn’t protect it from the economic uncertainty that is making shoppers cautious. Customers in the fourth quarter were quite price sensitive and less likely to buy bigger-ticket items, Olsavsky said.In the quarter the company made progress in right-sizing its operations and cutting costs, however, including “continued efficiencies across our transportation network,” he said, adding, “We remain focused on driving cost efficiencies throughout the network and reducing our cost to serve our customers, while ensuring we maintain an outstanding customer experience.” Jassy also emphasized the company’s ongoing streamlining of its operations.But retail at Amazon may need attention beyond sweetening its Prime membership or speeding up its fulfillment.“Management has spent most of the past year trying to make repairs in the form of reining in spending, but the actions were not sufficient to save the quarter or the fiscal year,” GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said in emailed comments, noting that the company’s overall Q4 revenue reflected its “slowest final quarter growth in over 10 years.”That’s due in part to the macroeconomic pressures cited byOlsavsky.“However, Amazon underperformed the market so must shoulder some responsibility for its numbers. All the deterioration came from online, where sales dropped by 2.3%,” Saunders said, adding that while physical stores did better, much of their growth came from inflation rather than volume growth.What has become a somewhat chaotic online experience is partly to blame, according to Saunders.“While the Amazon marketplace is far from a terrible place to shop, it has become more complex and cluttered with a multitude of products, delivery options, and prices levels for shoppers to sift through,” he said. “The result is that impulse buying has dropped and that more people are migrating away to other retailers. This is not yet a serious problem as erosion has only happened at the margins, but it is something Amazon will need to address and arrest to prevent further decline.”",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-plans-further-improvements-to-prime-membership-as-q4-sales-slip/641918/,True

Amazon touts record Black Friday weekend sales,"Published Dec. 1, 2022","Dive Brief:Amazon said ina Wednesday press releasethat the 2022 Thanksgiving weekend was its biggest holiday shopping weekend ever and that it sold “hundreds of millions” of products during the period. The e-commerce giant declined to share exact figures with Retail Dive regarding how many products it sold between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday and how much revenue it generated compared to previous years.The company said home, fashion, toys, beauty and Amazon devices were among the top-selling categories. Amazon’s Echo Dot and Fire TV Stick, and Apple’s AirPods, were some of the best-selling items during that weekend. Champion and New Balance apparel also did well.Shoppers spent more than $1 billion with small businesses, per the press release. Among the most purchased items from small businesses were games like “What Do You Meme? Family Edition” and “Kids Against Maturity: Card Game For Kids and Families.”Dive Insight:Multiple reports suggest that this year’s Thanksgiving weekend sales were up over last year. Adobe Analytics found that Cyber Monday salesgrew 5.8% compared to 2021, reaching$11.3 billion.

Digital channels like mobile also thrived: AnotherAdobe reportfound that mobile shopping on Thanksgiving Day rose 8.3% year over year and comprised 55% of online retail sales.Amazon, too, is touting a record shopping weekend, although the company declined to share precise figures. The results come after a slightly underwhelming October sales event for the retailer. The Prime Early Access sale was estimated to have fallen short of Amazon’s annual Prime Day sale over the summer, and Numeratorfound that the average order size dropped 23%to $46.68 when compared to its July sale.Adobe found that the retailer’s Prime Day event over the summersaw online sales rise by 8.5%year over year to $11.9 billion, but even that holiday was shaped by negative trends. Consumersspent much of their Prime Day budget on essentials and smaller purchases, according to data from Numerator.“This was a record-breaking holiday shopping weekend for Amazon. Customers shopped millions of deals this weekend and we have many more amazing deals to come,” Doug Herrington, CEO of Worldwide Amazon Stores, said in a statement.Even as Amazon teases its sales growth, the retailer is preparing to cut back its workforce.

Amazon’s fall sales event estimated to have fallen short of Prime Day — while still raking in billions,"Published Oct. 14, 2022","Amazon said that “tens of millions” of Prime members shopped its October sales event this week, with customers buying more than100 million itemsfrom third-party sellers on its Marketplace, according to a Thursday press release.The event, meant to kick off the holiday season, follows Amazon’s traditional Prime Day in July. Some outside estimates show the e-commerce giant’s October event falling short of Prime Day.According to consumerdata firm Numerator, the average order size during the Prime Early Access sale in October was $46.68, down nearly 23% from Prime Day in July.Bank of America analyst Justin Post estimated that Amazon’s October event generated $8 billion in gross merchandise volume, a 25% decline from $10.7 billion in GMV for the July Prime Day sale.In revenue terms, that would mean around $5.7 billion for Amazon compared to Post’s $7.5 billion revenue estimate for Prime Day.Even though it fell short of this year’s Prime Day, Post pointed to upside for Amazon going into the holidays. “Ultimately, we view this Early Access event as incrementally beneficial, as both a branding event for Prime and potentially smoothing holiday demand aiding with logistics,” Post said in the note.Amazon said some of the best selling items from the event included Macbook Air M1 laptops, Peloton bikes, Bose brand earbuds and headphones, Casper pillows and toppers, and Shark hair dryers, vacuums and air purifiers. At the category level, Amazon said apparel, home, toys and the company’s own devices were among the best sellers. The company specifically cited over 8 million toys in the U.S. sold during the sale.Those categories largely track with Numerator’s findings as well, which found (based on surveys) the most popular categories to be (in order), household essentials, health and beauty, apparel and shoes, toys and video games, and electronics.Of those Early Access shoppers, 29% said they used the sale to buy holiday gifts, and 95% said they’re likely to shop Amazon for more gifts as the season winds on, according to Numerator.Withconsumers grappling with inflation, retail observers are watching to see whether consumers pounce on early sales, or hold out for better deals.

EVgo and Amazon team up for voice-enabled EV charging,"Published Jan. 11, 2023","Dive Brief:Electric vehicle charging company EVgo is partnering with Amazon to help electric vehicle driversfind EVgo charging stationsand pay for their charge via Amazon’s Alexa virtual assistant, according to a Thursday press release.The partnership will allow users with Alexa-enabled vehicles or those using Alexa automotive accessories to access data on 150,000 public charging stations through the Plugshare application programming interface beginning later in 2023.EVgo chargers are installed at a number of convenience store chains across the country, including some 7-Eleven, Wawa, Sheetz, Chevron andPilotlocations.Dive Insight:This integration could make it easier and faster for drivers to find and use chargers in their home area or while on the road.“EV charging is a great example of a task that can be simplified and made more convenient through the power of AI,” said Anes Hodžić, vice president, Amazon Smart Vehicles, in the release. “We’re bringing Alexa’s AI and multi-modal experiences to improve the EV charging experience for drivers and streamline the process of locating, initiating and paying for a charging session.”The data in thePlugshareAPI, owned byEVgo,is largely provided by other EV users, who check in when they visit a charger and submit certain information, like if there were problems with the charger or what condition the location was in. The companies plan to eventually integrate real-time information on which chargers are in use — along with account and billing information — into the Alexa interface.It was not immediately clear if paying via Alexa could help bypass the issue of a kiosknot accepting payment, a common problem at malfunctioning chargers. It also wasn’t clear if all information from the API would be fed to users. ThePlugshareAPI asks users to report not only the chargers they’re using, but any issues they encounter, including chargers that don’t work — data that could be helpful for drivers.EVgo did not respond by press time to an inquiry for more information.This voice-enabled EV charging and payments are the latest steps toward making charging as frictionless as possible. EVgo also recently released Autocharge+, which enables a driver’s car to be recognized by the EVgo network and begin charging as soon as it’s plugged in, rather than having to trigger the transaction on the charger or in a mobile device like normal.“EVgo is committed to continuing to raise the bar for convenience of EV ownership for our customers,” Cathy Zoi, CEO at EVgo, said in the release.EVgo owns more than 850 fast charging locations in more than 30 states.

Amazon launches cash advance program for merchants,"Published Nov. 2, 2022","Dive Brief:Adding another financial service for its sellers, Amazon has teamed up with Parafin, a U.S.-based financial services firm, to offer cash advances to merchants,the e-commerce company announced on Tuesday.Sellers can access between $500 and $10 million to grow their businesses without fixed terms, credit checks, late fees or extensive paperwork. Amazon will offer its sellers cash advances on a flexible payment schedule based on a fixed percentage of their gross merchandise sales until the loan is repaid.Merchants won’t have to make minimum payments, pay interest and put up collateral for the loan, but they do have to pay a fixed capital fee. Amazon is introducing the financing option to select American businesses as of Tuesday, and it will make the service available to “hundreds of thousands of sellers by early 2023,” per the announcement.Dive Insight:Amazon is further entrenching itself in the financial services industry.

Its stock price hasfallen significantly since its debut, but the retailer has forged ahead with new partnerships to expand its reach.TheHonest Company signed a deal with Walmartin July to sell its products both in stores and online, including items like diapers, eczema relief products, wipes and other personal care items. The following month, the companyexpanded its wholesale deal with Ulta Beautyto include more than 635 of the beauty retailer’s physical stores.Incoming CEO Vernón comes from another wholesale partner, Amazon.

Amazon confirms layoffs,"Published Nov. 17, 2022","Amazon on Wednesday confirmed layoffs have started at the company.The New York Timesreported earlier in the weekthat the company planned to lay off as many as 10,000 employees with a focus on its retail operations and device division, along with human resources.Amazon has decided toconsolidate some teamsand programs, according to a message from Dave Limp, senior vice president of devices and services. The company further noted that the positions are corporate and tech, and that roles within its operations network are not included.Impacted employees were notified on Tuesday.“As part of our annual operating planning review process, we always look at each of our businesses and what we believe we should change,” Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement. “As we’ve gone through this, given the current macro-economic environment (as well as several years of rapid hiring), some teams are making adjustments, which in some cases means certain roles are no longer necessary. We don’t take these decisions lightly, and we are working to support any employees who may be affected.”The company is assisting those employees in finding new roles internally and, if that is not possible, providing a package that includes a separation payment, transition benefits and external job placement support.Limp said that the devices and services organization continues to be a focus for Amazon.Earlier in the month, Amazon said it waspausing hiringin its corporate workforce temporarily in light of an uncertain economy.",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-confirms-layoffs/636817/,False
Inflation reshapes Amazon Prime Day,"Published July 14, 2022","Dive Brief:With its 2022 Prime Day event over, Amazon on Thursday said that, globally, Prime members (the only ones allowed to shop the deals)bought more than 300 million items, surpassing other years. The e-retailer declined to provide the event’s revenue.Still, at a time of peak inflation, consumerskept much of their Prime Day shopping to essentialsand smaller purchases, according to Numerator, which found that just 5% of items sold for over $100, while 58% sold for under $20.As in previous years, Prime Day lifted other U.S. retailers as well, according to the Adobe Digital Economy Index. U.S. online spending nearly reached $12 billion ($6 billion on Tuesday, $5.9 billion on Wednesday), an 8.5% increase over last year. Stores played a role, with conversion for retailers offering curbside pickup and BOPIS up 20% compared to an average day in June, Adobe said by email.Dive Insight:The burst of online spending during Prime Day was not quite as robust as it seems, given thatinflation in the U.S. reached 9.1% in June, according to the latest consumer price index report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Moreover, inflation’s influence went beyond undermining the raw headline numbers to reshaping consumer behavior. A little over a third of Prime Day customers waited for the sale to get a certain item at a discount, while 28% passed on a good deal because it wasn't a necessity, Numerator found.“The mix of things bought is also of interest,” GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said by email, noting that Amazon flagged household essentials as a best-selling category. “Diapers also did well. These things are staple purchases rather than impulse purchases, which suggests more consumers are focusing on things they need rather than things they want.”That will almost certainly mean lower sales of such items in coming weeks, as people work through what they’ve stocked up on at home, he noted.Consumers were also planning ahead, and leveraging Prime Day to check things off shopping lists beyond household essentials, according to Natalie Kotlyar, who leads the retail industry group at consultancy BDO. This year, Amazon forged partnerships with top brands like Apple and KitchenAid that helped draw people in, she said by phone.“Now more than ever, with inflation, consumers are looking to buy products that they truly need,” she said. “Some did buy products for either back to school — again, essential products for back to school — and some even started to buy products for for the holiday season, especially where there were great deals to be had.”Amazon once again this year focused its press release on its third-party sellers, which it says are mostly small- and medium-sized businesses. The company’s marketplace has long been responsible for most of the goods sold on its site, and provides lucrative streams of revenue in the form of fulfillment and warehousing fees and, increasingly, advertising sales.This year, customers spent over $3 billion on more than 100 million small business items included in the “Support Small Businesses to Win Big sweepstakes,” whichran before Prime Day, from June 21 through July 11, per Amazon’s release.Speculation continues over whether Amazonwould schedule a second Prime Daythis year, something it has never done and declines to comment on. BDO’s Kotlyar believes the e-commerce giant will be content to stage a Black Friday event, with some deals offered only to Prime members, without branding it “Prime Day.” Others are not so sure.Consumers are pulling back their online spending and plan to spend less in the next six months, according to research from Attest.  “With such uncertainty, it is little surprise that Amazon could potentially hold a second Prime event at the end of this year in order to maximize sales,” Attest CEO Jeremy King said by email.",https://www.retaildive.com/news/inflation-impacts-amazon-prime-day-sales/627262/,True
"Grove Collaborative expands into Walmart, Amazon","Published Feb. 14, 2023","Expanding its wholesale channels, Grove Collaborative’s flagship home care brandwill be availableon Amazon and in select Walmart stores.The company — a Certified B. Corp. focused on selling more sustainable consumer products — will be rolling out select household items on Amazon, including hand and dish soaps, this month and will add more to the selection during the first half of the year, according to a press release. Grove Collaborative already sells products on Amazon from its Peach not Plastic and Superbloom brands, which it says have reached $1 million in sales.An assortment of Grove Collaborative’s foaming and gel hand soaps have begun rolling out to more than 1,000 Walmart stores and online. Select Peach not Plastic and Superbloom products will also be available on the mass retailer’s website.“Our vision has always been to change the industry to be more sustainable, and with retail being where consumers make 90% of the category purchases, expanding our retail presence is critical as we aim to grow our impact,” Stuart Landesberg, co-founder and CEO of Grove Collaborative, said in a statement. “We’re excited to bring SKUs that have previously only been available DTC to Walmart and Amazon.”""Brands that don’t have a strong DTC presence will always be disadvantaged in digital, and brands that can’t show up in retail will miss a critical touch point when so many customers are still making in-store transactions.”Stuart LandesbergCo-founder and CEO, Grove CollaborativeWhile Grove does operate a direct-to-consumer e-commerce site, Landesberg told Retail Dive that the company goes where its customers are.“We continue to believe that direct to consumer and digitally enabled commerce is going to play an important role in how consumers discover new products and find the products they love on a regular basis,” Landesberg told Retail Dive via email. “I think what we’re seeing in the category is that there is real value to omnichannel. Brands that don’t have a strong DTC presence will always be disadvantaged in digital, and brands that can’t show up in retail will miss a critical touch point when so many customers are still making in-store transactions.”The move into Walmart and Amazon comes after Groveclosed on a $72 million term loanin December, which it will use to refinance existing debt in a push toward profitability. The company hadreceived a delistingnotice from the New York Stock Exchange a few weeks earlier, notifying it that its stock was not in compliance with having an average closing share price of at least $1.00 over a 30-day trading period. It has six months to regain compliance, and at the time of publication, Grove’s stock is trading at 42 cents.Grove’s third-quarter earnings report in November showed a net revenue decline of 18% year over year, and its net loss swung to a profit of $7.7 million. Anticipating revenue between $313 million and $320 million, the company raised its full-year outlook.With profitability being key for the company right now, Landesberg wants to make sure that it’s achieved sustainably, adding that “profitability is absolutely top of mind” and it affords the company the ability to “control our own destiny and have the privilege of continuing to introduce consumers to sustainable products that can, little by little, change the world.”The company’s latest expansion adds to its products available at other retailers such as selectCVS, Harris Teeter, H-E-B, Meijer, Giant Eagle and Target. Although the company has been expanding its wholesale presence, Landesberg noted it has seen success with its DTC channel in the midst of economic pressures.“[F]rom a business perspective we are being prudent,” Landesberg said. “With that said, we’ve seen a pretty healthy consumer, especially on DTC. We certainly have plans in place to execute if we start to see that our consumer shows signs of extreme financial pressure, but that hasn’t materialized quite yet. One reason could be that the growing importance of sustainability to consumers is a counterbalancing force.”Sustainability is atough thing for retailersto accomplish, but Landesberg is confident that shoppers will continue to seek out more solutions through the products they buy.“I can’t be certain about how the macro trends will play out in 2023,” Landesberg said. “But I can be sure that consumers will continue to be moved to take action in their own lives to address the environmental crises of today and tomorrow; and we are well positioned for that.”",https://www.retaildive.com/news/grove-collaborative-expands-into-walmart-amazon/642678/,False
Amazon rebrands discounted membership as it launches Amazon Access hub,"Published Oct. 4, 2022","Dive Brief:Amazon unveiled a hub for discounts, affordability programs and other features dubbed Amazon Access,the retailer announced Monday. Within Amazon Access, shoppers can also view information about Prime Access, the retailer's newly renamed discounted membership program for recipients of government assistance.In addition to Prime Access, customers can find information on Amazon Layaway, SNAP EBT and discounts. Shoppers can also pay online without a debit or credit card, and pick up purchases at lockers or pickup counters.Prime Access is $6.99 per month, less than half the full Prime membership cost. From 2019 to 2021, membership into the program increasedby more than 300%, per the announcement.Customers who receive government assistance can upload their identification or government assistance documentation to see if they’re qualified.Dive Insight:The retailer’s push to make Amazon Prime benefits and discounts more accessible to a broader group of consumers follows price hikes for its main membership earlier this year. In February, the retailerincreased its Prime membership feefor the first time since 2018. The change, from $119 to $139, came after a challenging fourth quarter where the e-commerce behemoth saw its operating expenses rise 12.9% to $134 billion and its operating income drop by nearly half to $3.5 billion.The e-commerce giant continued to face challenges in the second quarter. Though the company reported a 7% increase in net sales to $121.2 billion in its second quarter,its Q2 net loss was $2 billion, and its operating income dropped from $7.7 billion to $3.3 billion.To incentivize Prime enrollment for consumers seeking early holiday deals, Amazonintroduced a second sale for Prime memberson October 11–12 in 15 countries and debuted a holiday gift guide featuring major brands, including KitchenAid and Peloton. In a similar move, Target is also offering its holiday deals in October, but it's doing so on Oct. 6–8 and also giving customers a price match guarantee.The rollout of discounts comes as consumers seek bargains in response to inflation woes. AMorning Consult surveyreleased in August found that85% of respondents cited increasing inflationas the reason behind their changing shopping habits. While 79% of respondents sought discounts from retailers, 77% had reduced their shopping. As consumers try to stretch their dollars this holiday season, they will likelyshop around for the best priceand begin shopping well before the holidays arrive.",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-launches-amazon-access-hub-prime-access/633259/,True
Amazon schedules Prime Day for mid-July,"Published June 16, 2022","Dive Brief:Prime Day this yearwill commenceat midnight Pacific Daylight Time on July 12 and run through July 13, Amazon said on Thursday. The sale is open only to those with aPrime membership, which costs $139 per year or $14.99 per month in the U.S.Deals on Amazon devices like Echo speakers, Kindle and Fire tablets, Ring security kits, Blink doorbells, Eero WiFi routers and Fire televisions will roll out this month, beginning June 21, per a company press release.Prime Day will also take place in Austria, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, the U.K., Poland and Sweden. Later this summer, Prime Day events will be held in India, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.Dive Insight:To promote its big summer sale this year, Amazon turned to piano virtuoso Jon Batiste, who riffs on Billy Ocean’s “Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car” with a twist, “get into my cart.”Some of the items Batiste is dreaming about adding to the cart — a sequined pillow, not one but two massagers, a camera drone, three-man canoe or a new grill — may not be quite essential enough for consumers, who have cut back on discretionary spending as inflation encroaches on their household budgets.But the sale is timed well, considering that more consumers are alsoseeking out discounts and clipping coupons. A great majority of Amazon Prime members plan to shop the sale, but say they’ll bemore careful about what they buy, according to research from coupon company RetailMeNot. As a result, shoppers on average are set to spend$388 during Prime Daythis year, down quite a bit from last year’s $594.Moreover, not all of that will be spent at Amazon, with RetailMeNot finding rivals are likely to get $155 of it as they promote their own summertime deals. In past years, retailers including Walmart, Target, Kohl’s, Dick’s, Best Buy, Bed Bath & Beyond, Office Depot, Staples and Joann, among many others, have made a point ofanswering Prime Daywith their own deal days.Almost half of survey respondents also told RetailMeNotthat they will wait until Prime Day to make their biggest purchases of the year. That could include back-to-school or even holiday purchases.",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-prime-day-mid-july/625624/,True
What Amazon’s product updates say about its strategy,"Published Sept. 29, 2022","Amazon’s latest product announcements and updates on Wednesday demonstrate a core strategy: to be as integrated into the lives of consumers and business owners as possible.Among the many changes announced during its press-only event, Amazon debuted a sleep tracking alarm clock, a new Kindle that allows users to write on it, an enhanced shopping feature for the Echo Show and updates to its Astro robot to help businesses dealing with crime.One particular update to its security device line was meant for small business owners. Amazon’s Astro robot, which is known for being an at-home assistant, will now have a Virtual Security Guard integration. For U.S. business owners who are willing to pay the added subscription fee, this robot can patrol the store while nobody is present. It can also connect with support at Rapid Response to remotely control the robot and have a two-way talk with the intruders.“Whether you own a coffee shop, car dealership, jewelry store, or salon, your business deserves the same protection your home gets when you use Ring Alarm,” Andrew Vloyanetes, Amazon’s general manager for Ring,said in a blog post. “Just as we have done for our residential customers, we continue to create customizable solutions you can tailor to your business’ needs. I’m excited to continue innovating with businesses in mind, all in the spirit of our mission to make neighborhoods safer.”The Halo Rise clock can detect the humidity and temperature of the room to provide optimal sleep recommendations.Courtesy of AmazonThe new Halo Rise device brings aunique approachto sleep tracking. Instead of requiring a customer to wear a smartwatch, the clock uses a low-energy sensor to monitor the breathing patterns of the sleeper closest to it. There is no camera or microphone in the device, which is also able to wake users up with a sunrise-like light and provides recommendations to improve your room’s environment. The company told Retail Dive that Halo Rise does not collect any biometric data.In addition to sleep tracking, the mass retailer is hoping to help consumers shop more efficiently from home. The Echo Show’s newShop the Lookfunctionality allows users to voice what they are looking for—such as “show me green leggings”—and receive other recommendations to go along with it on screen.Amazon is a major player in the smart home market, and these product releases show it doesn’t plan to change that. Expanding its smart devices into businesses could be a way to strengthen its market share. The smart home market in the U.S. isexpected to reach$31.5 billion in revenue in 2022, a 9% increase from around $28 billion in 2021, according to data from Statista.Behind Amazon's smart home strategy is the belief in what itcalls ambient intelligence, which is described as the concept that ""technology is working for you when you need it, but recedes into the background when you don't. A home is like a device with many different devices inside. What we're doing now is we're stitching that all together so technology can do things for you without you having to tell it,” according toMarjaKoopmans, director of health and smart home at Amazon.",https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-product-updates-retail-tech-strategy-kindle-echo-halo-rise/632950/,False
